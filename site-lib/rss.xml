Unlike aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG), window functions do not collapse rows into a single output row. Instead, they provide a result for each row while considering a "window" or subset of rows defined by a specific criterion.window_function(expression) OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name) window_function: The specific function to apply, such as ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.
OVER: Specifies that the function is a window function.
PARTITION BY: (Optional) Divides the rows into partitions to perform the calculation within each partition.
ORDER BY: (Optional) Defines the order of rows within the partition. Assigns a unique sequential number to each row within a partition.
SELECT EmployeeID, Department, Salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS RowNum
FROM Employees; Assigns a rank to each row. Ties receive the same rank, and gaps are left in the ranking sequence.
SELECT EmployeeID, Department, Salary, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS Rank
FROM Employees; Similar to RANK(), but does not leave gaps in the ranking sequence for ties.
SELECT EmployeeID, Department, Salary, DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS DenseRank
FROM Employees; Calculates the running total within each partition.
SELECT EmployeeID, Department, Salary, SUM(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS RunningTotal
FROM Employees; Calculates the running average within each partition.
SELECT EmployeeID, Department, Salary, AVG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS RunningAverage
FROM Employees; Finds the maximum or minimum value within the partition or window.
SELECT EmployeeID, Department, Salary, MAX(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department) AS MaxSalary
FROM Employees; Accesses the value from the next row within the partition.
SELECT EmployeeID, Department, Salary, LEAD(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS NextSalary
FROM Employees; Accesses the value from the previous row within the partition.
SELECT EmployeeID, Department, Salary, LAG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY EmployeeID) AS PrevSalary
FROM Employees; Running Totals and Averages Track cumulative sums or averages within groups of data (e.g., monthly sales totals). Ranking and Sorting Rank rows within categories (e.g., top 3 salaries by department). Comparing Rows Compare current row values to previous or next rows (e.g., detecting trends or changes). Data Analysis Perform analytics without collapsing rows (e.g., finding maximum values within groups while retaining original data). Indexing: Ensure columns used in PARTITION BY and ORDER BY clauses are indexed to improve performance. Large Datasets: Window functions can be computationally expensive on large datasets; optimize queries by limiting rows with WHERE clauses or pre-aggregating data. Memory Usage: Be mindful of memory usage when dealing with large partitions, as the window functions may need to maintain large intermediate result sets. Window functions are powerful tools for performing calculations across a set of rows related to the current row without reducing the result set.
They enhance SQL's capability for data analysis, providing insights such as rankings, running totals, and comparisons.
Proper use of window functions can lead to more efficient and readable queries, especially when dealing with complex analytical tasks.

Views and Materialized Views are essential database objects that allow you to simplify and optimize your SQL queries. They provide a way to store query results for easier and faster access.
Views are virtual tables representing the result of a query, while Materialized Views physically store the query results for faster retrieval. A View is a virtual table based on the result of a SELECT query.
It does not store data physically but provides a saved query that dynamically retrieves data from underlying tables when queried.
Changes to the underlying tables are reflected in the view.
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
CREATE VIEW HighSalaryEmployees AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary &gt; 50000;
SELECT * FROM HighSalaryEmployees; If the view is based on a simple query, you can sometimes update the underlying table through the view.
UPDATE HighSalaryEmployees
SET Salary = 60000
WHERE EmployeeID = 101; Simplifies Complex Queries: Store frequently used complex queries for easy reuse. Security: Restrict access to specific columns or rows by granting permissions on the view, not the base table. Abstraction: Provide a layer of abstraction, allowing changes to underlying tables without affecting queries using the view. Performance: Since views are virtual, querying a view can be slower for large datasets due to dynamic computation. Cannot Always Be Updated: Views with complex joins, aggregations, or subqueries may not be updatable. A Materialized View is a physical copy of the result of a query that is stored on disk.
Unlike regular views, materialized views store the data, making queries against them much faster.
Materialized views need to be refreshed periodically to stay up-to-date with the underlying data.
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW HighSalaryEmployeesMV AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary &gt; 50000; Materialized views can be refreshed manually or automatically to reflect changes in the underlying tables.
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW HighSalaryEmployeesMV;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW HighSalaryEmployeesMV
BUILD IMMEDIATE
REFRESH FAST ON COMMIT
AS
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary &gt; 50000; Performance: Faster query performance for large datasets because data is precomputed and stored. Precomputed Data: Useful for complex calculations or aggregations that don't change frequently. Reduced Database Load: Reduces the load on the database by avoiding repeated complex computations. Storage Overhead: Requires additional storage space for the precomputed data. Stale Data: Data can become outdated unless the materialized view is refreshed regularly. Maintenance Overhead: Refreshing materialized views can add maintenance complexity and resource usage. Use Views When: You need to simplify complex queries.
You want to provide a security layer by restricting access to specific columns or rows. Use Materialized Views When: Performance is critical for querying large datasets.
You have complex aggregations or calculations that do not change frequently. Optimize Refresh Strategies: For frequently changing data, use incremental (FAST) refresh where possible.
For infrequently changing data, use manual or periodic refresh to save resources. Views and Materialized Views are powerful tools for managing and optimizing SQL queries.
Choosing between them depends on your performance needs, data freshness requirements, and storage considerations.
Understanding their differences and appropriate use cases can help you design more efficient and maintainable database solutions.

Subqueries (also known as inner queries) are queries nested inside other SQL statements, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. They allow you to dynamically use the results of one query as input or conditions for another.
Correlated subqueries are a special type of subquery that references one or more columns from the outer query. Unlike a regular subquery, a correlated subquery is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query, making it more dynamic but potentially less performant.
Subqueries can be categorized based on the type of results they return and how they are used:A scalar subquery returns a single value (one row, one column). It is often used in the SELECT clause or WHERE clause.SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees) AS MaxSalary
FROM Employees; Explanation: The subquery returns the maximum salary. The outer query then shows each employee's details along with this maximum salary.
A row subquery returns a single row with multiple columns. It is used with conditions that expect multiple values, such as WHERE or IN clauses.SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE (DepartmentID, Salary) = ( SELECT DepartmentID, MAX(Salary) FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentName = 'Sales'
); Explanation: The subquery finds the DepartmentID and the highest salary for the "Sales" department. The outer query returns employees who match both these criteria.
A column subquery returns a single column with multiple rows. It is typically used with the IN clause to filter based on multiple values.SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID IN ( SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE Location = 'New York'
); Explanation: The subquery retrieves all DepartmentIDs located in New York. The outer query returns employees who belong to any of these departments.
A table subquery returns multiple rows and columns, essentially functioning like a derived table. It is used in the FROM clause.SELECT d.DepartmentName, e.EmployeeCount
FROM ( SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID
) e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID; Explanation: The subquery aggregates employees by department. The outer query joins this result with the Departments table to get department names and employee counts.
An EXISTS subquery checks if any rows meet the conditions specified in the subquery and returns a Boolean value (TRUE or FALSE).SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees e
WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM Orders o WHERE o.EmployeeID = e.EmployeeID
); Explanation: The subquery checks if there are any orders linked to each employee. The outer query returns employees who have processed at least one order.
A regular subquery is a query enclosed in parentheses and embedded inside a larger query. It can be executed independently of the outer query. Filtering Results in a WHERE Clause:
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID = ( SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentName = 'Sales'
); Using Subqueries in the FROM Clause (Derived Tables):
SELECT d.DepartmentName, e.EmployeeCount
FROM ( SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID
) e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID; Subqueries in the SELECT List:
SELECT FirstName, LastName, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders WHERE Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID) AS OrderCount
FROM Employees; A correlated subquery references columns from the outer query, making it dependent on the outer query's current row.SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.Salary &gt; ( SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees e2 WHERE e2.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
); Explanation: The subquery calculates the average salary for each employee's department. The outer query returns employees whose salaries exceed this average. Choose the Right Subquery Type: Use scalar subqueries for single-value lookups.
Use table subqueries when you need derived tables.
Use correlated subqueries for row-specific logic. Optimize Correlated Subqueries: Replace with joins, CTEs, or window functions where possible.
Ensure columns used in subquery conditions are indexed. Example Optimization:
WITH DeptAvgSalary AS ( SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgSalary FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID
)
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employees e
JOIN DeptAvgSalary das ON e.DepartmentID = das.DepartmentID
WHERE e.Salary &gt; das.AvgSalary; Subqueries and correlated subqueries are essential tools for dynamic and complex SQL queries.
Choose the appropriate type of subquery based on the requirement to balance readability and performance.
Always consider optimizing correlated subqueries for large datasets to avoid performance bottlenecks.

SQL is used to perform operations such as querying data, updating records, and managing database objects. Understanding SQL syntax is crucial for writing clear, efficient, and error-free SQL statements.SQL statements generally follow this structure:SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column ASC | DESC; SELECT: Specifies the columns to retrieve.
FROM: Specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from.
WHERE: Filters rows based on specified conditions.
GROUP BY: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
HAVING: Filters grouped rows based on conditions.
ORDER BY: Sorts the result set.
SQL keywords are case-insensitive, but it's a common practice to write them in uppercase for readability.Retrieves data from a table.SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'Sales';
Adds new rows to a table.INSERT INTO Employees (FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)
VALUES ('Alice', 'Smith', 'HR', 60000);
Modifies existing rows in a table.UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = 70000
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
Removes rows from a table.DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
Filters rows based on a condition.SELECT * FROM Products
WHERE Price &gt; 100;
Groups rows with the same values.SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
Filters groups based on conditions (used with GROUP BY).SELECT Department, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 5;
Sorts results in ascending or descending order.SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY Salary DESC;
Combines results of two or more SELECT statements (removes duplicates).SELECT FirstName FROM Employees
UNION
SELECT FirstName FROM Customers;
Combines results without removing duplicates.SELECT FirstName FROM Employees
UNION ALL
SELECT FirstName FROM Customers;
CREATE TABLE Employees ( EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY, FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, Salary FLOAT CHECK (Salary &gt; 0)
); SQL syntax forms the foundation for interacting with relational databases.
Knowing how to use common clauses (SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, etc.) enables you to write effective queries.
Combining SQL statements with constraints, operators, and data types helps you build robust database solutions.

PIVOT and UNPIVOT are SQL operations used to transform data between row-oriented and column-oriented formats.
PIVOT turns unique values from one column into multiple columns, restructuring rows into a cross-tabular format.
UNPIVOT does the opposite: it converts columns into rows, flattening a cross-tabular structure back into a normalized format.
The PIVOT operator transforms rows into columns, aggregating data based on specified criteria.SELECT column1, column2, [pivoted_column1], [pivoted_column2], ...
FROM (source_query)
PIVOT ( aggregation_function(value_column) FOR pivot_column IN ([pivoted_value1], [pivoted_value2], ...)
) AS alias;
Suppose we have the following Sales table:We want to pivot the Month values so that each month becomes a separate column.SELECT Employee, [January], [February]
FROM ( SELECT Employee, Month, Sales FROM Sales
) AS SourceTable
PIVOT ( SUM(Sales) FOR Month IN ([January], [February])
) AS PivotTable; Source Query:
The inner query retrieves the data to be pivoted.
Aggregation:
The SUM(Sales) function aggregates the sales data.
Pivot Column:
The FOR Month IN ([January], [February]) clause specifies the unique values to pivot.
The UNPIVOT operator converts columns into rows, effectively reversing a PIVOT operation.SELECT column1, column2, pivot_column, value_column
FROM (source_query)
UNPIVOT ( value_column FOR pivot_column IN ([pivoted_column1], [pivoted_column2], ...)
) AS alias;
Suppose we have the following SalesSummary table (which is the result of the previous PIVOT):We want to unpivot the January and February columns back into rows.SELECT Employee, Month, Sales
FROM SalesSummary
UNPIVOT ( Sales FOR Month IN ([January], [February])
) AS UnpivotTable; Source Table:
The SalesSummary table is the starting point for the UNPIVOT.
Sales:
The Sales column holds the values from the unpivoted columns.
FOR Month IN ([January], [February]):
The column names January and February are converted into row values under the Month column. Generating Reports: Creating summary reports where categories (e.g., months, products) become columns. Data Analysis: Comparing data across multiple dimensions (e.g., sales per region). Normalizing Data: Transforming wide tables into a normalized form suitable for analysis. Preparing Data for Visualization: Many visualization tools work better with long-format data. Unique Values: For PIVOT, the values specified in the IN clause should be unique in the pivot column. Aggregation: PIVOT requires an aggregation function like SUM, COUNT, or AVG. Aliases: Always provide aliases for subqueries and the resulting PIVOT or UNPIVOT tables. SQL Dialect: PIVOT and UNPIVOT are supported in SQL Server and Oracle. In MySQL and PostgreSQL, you can achieve similar results using conditional aggregation or custom queries. PIVOT and UNPIVOT are powerful SQL operations for reshaping data.
PIVOT transforms rows into columns, while UNPIVOT does the opposite.
Knowing when and how to use these operations helps you manage data effectively for reporting and analysis.

It helps synchronize data between two tables by conditionally inserting, updating, or deleting rows based on whether certain conditions are met.The MERGE statement is also known as UPSERT (a combination of UPDATE and INSERT) because it allows you to insert new records or update existing records depending on whether a match is found.MERGE INTO target_table AS target
USING source_table AS source
ON target.key = source.key
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET target.column1 = source.column1
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (column1, column2) VALUES (source.column1, source.column2); target_table: The table that will be updated or inserted into.
source_table: The table or data source providing the data for comparison.
ON: The condition to determine if rows in the target_table and source_table match.
WHEN MATCHED: The action to perform when a match is found (usually an UPDATE).
WHEN NOT MATCHED: The action to perform when no match is found (usually an INSERT).
This example updates records if they exist and inserts them if they don’t.MERGE INTO Employees AS target
USING NewEmployeeData AS source
ON target.EmployeeID = source.EmployeeID
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET target.FirstName = source.FirstName, target.LastName = source.LastName, target.Salary = source.Salary
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary) VALUES (source.EmployeeID, source.FirstName, source.LastName, source.Salary); Explanation: If an employee in the target table matches an employee in the source table by EmployeeID, the FirstName, LastName, and Salary are updated.
If no match is found, a new employee record is inserted. You can also delete rows from the target table if certain conditions are met.MERGE INTO Employees AS target
USING UpdatedEmployeeData AS source
ON target.EmployeeID = source.EmployeeID
WHEN MATCHED AND source.IsTerminated = 1 THEN DELETE
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary) VALUES (source.EmployeeID, source.FirstName, source.LastName, source.Salary); Explanation: If an employee exists in both tables and IsTerminated is set to 1 in the source table, the employee record is deleted from the target table.
If no match is found, a new employee record is inserted. You can have multiple WHEN MATCHED or WHEN NOT MATCHED clauses to handle different conditions.MERGE INTO Products AS target
USING NewProducts AS source
ON target.ProductID = source.ProductID
WHEN MATCHED AND source.Price &lt;&gt; target.Price THEN UPDATE SET target.Price = source.Price
WHEN MATCHED AND source.Discontinued = 1 THEN DELETE
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (ProductID, ProductName, Price) VALUES (source.ProductID, source.ProductName, source.Price); Explanation: Updates the price if it differs.
Deletes the product if it is marked as discontinued.
Inserts new products if they don't exist in the target table. Atomic Operation: The MERGE statement is atomic, meaning all operations (insert, update, delete) happen within a single transaction. Efficiency: Combines multiple DML operations into one, reducing the number of separate queries and improving performance. Flexibility: You can mix and match UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE operations based on conditions. Error Handling: Ensure proper error handling and logging, especially when dealing with complex conditions. Indexing: Ensure the join columns in the ON clause are indexed for faster performance. Batch Size: For large datasets, consider breaking the MERGE into smaller batches to avoid locking issues. Transaction Management: Since MERGE is a single transaction, ensure your database can handle long-running transactions if processing large data. Logging and Auditing: Keep track of changes made by the MERGE operation for audit purposes. The MERGE statement is a powerful tool for performing upserts and synchronizing data between tables.
It combines INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations into a single, atomic statement, improving both readability and performance.
Proper indexing, batching, and error handling can help you maximize the efficiency of MERGE operations.

The LEAD() and LAG() functions are window functions in SQL used to access data from a subsequent (next) or preceding (previous) row relative to the current row.
They are commonly used for tasks like calculating differences between consecutive rows, comparing current and previous values, or tracking trends over time. The LEAD() function retrieves the value from a subsequent row within the same result set.
It allows you to look ahead by a specified number of rows and is useful for comparing current values with future values.
LEAD(expression, offset, default) OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column) expression: The column or expression to return from the subsequent row.
offset: The number of rows to look ahead (default is 1).
default: The value to return if there is no subsequent row (optional).
PARTITION BY: Divides the result set into partitions to apply the function separately within each group (optional).
ORDER BY: Specifies the order of rows within each partition.
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, Salary, LEAD(Salary, 1) OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS NextSalary
FROM Employees;
Explanation:
For each employee, the LEAD() function retrieves the salary of the next employee in descending order of salary. The LAG() function retrieves the value from a preceding row within the same result set.
It allows you to look back by a specified number of rows and is useful for comparing current values with past values.
LAG(expression, offset, default) OVER (PARTITION BY column ORDER BY column) expression: The column or expression to return from the preceding row.
offset: The number of rows to look back (default is 1).
default: The value to return if there is no preceding row (optional).
PARTITION BY: Divides the result set into partitions to apply the function separately within each group (optional).
ORDER BY: Specifies the order of rows within each partition.
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, Salary, LAG(Salary, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS PreviousSalary
FROM Employees;
Explanation:
For each employee, the LAG() function retrieves the salary of the previous employee in descending order of salary. If there is no previous row, it returns 0 as the default value.
You can use PARTITION BY to apply LEAD() and LAG() separately within each group.SELECT Department, EmployeeID, FirstName, Salary, LAG(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS PrevSalary, LEAD(Salary) OVER (PARTITION BY Department ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS NextSalary
FROM Employees;
Explanation:
The LAG() and LEAD() functions are applied within each department partition, ordered by salary in descending order. Calculating Differences Between Rows
Compare current and previous rows to calculate differences.
SELECT SalesDate, SalesAmount, LAG(SalesAmount) OVER (ORDER BY SalesDate) AS PreviousSales, SalesAmount - LAG(SalesAmount) OVER (ORDER BY SalesDate) AS SalesDifference
FROM Sales; Identifying Trends
Use LEAD() to identify upcoming values and detect trends.
SELECT StockDate, StockPrice, LEAD(StockPrice) OVER (ORDER BY StockDate) AS NextStockPrice, CASE WHEN LEAD(StockPrice) OVER (ORDER BY StockDate) &gt; StockPrice THEN 'Up' ELSE 'Down' END AS Trend
FROM StockPrices; Calculating Rolling Averages
Calculate rolling averages by combining LAG() with window functions.
SELECT EmployeeID, Salary, (Salary + LAG(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID) + LEAD(Salary) OVER (ORDER BY EmployeeID)) / 3 AS RollingAverage
FROM Employees; Indexing: Ensure columns used in the ORDER BY clause are indexed for better performance. Large Datasets: Window functions can be resource-intensive for large datasets. Consider limiting rows with WHERE clauses or optimizing partitions. Memory Usage: The database engine needs to maintain intermediate results for window functions, which can affect memory usage. LEAD() and LAG() are powerful for analyzing data trends, calculating differences, and performing row-by-row comparisons.
They work with the OVER clause, supporting PARTITION BY and ORDER BY for flexibility.

This is a fundamental concept in relational databases for querying data stored in different tables. JOIN operations allow you to create meaningful relationships and retrieve comprehensive datasets.
An INNER JOIN returns rows where there is a match in both tables.
If a row in one table does not have a corresponding row in the other table, that row is excluded from the result.

SELECT t1.column, t2.column
FROM table1 t1
LEFT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.common_column = t2.common_column;
SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
LEFT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID; A RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.
SELECT t1.column, t2.column
FROM table1 t1
RIGHT JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.common_column = t2.common_column;
SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
RIGHT JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID; A FULL JOIN returns all rows from both tables.
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without a match.
SELECT t1.column, t2.column
FROM table1 t1
FULL JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.common_column = t2.common_column;
SELECT Employees.EmployeeID, Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
FULL JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID; A CROSS JOIN returns the Cartesian product of two tables, meaning every row in the first table is combined with every row in the second table.
SELECT t1.column, t2.column
FROM table1 t1
CROSS JOIN table2 t2;
SELECT Employees.FirstName, Departments.DepartmentName
FROM Employees
CROSS JOIN Departments;
A self-join is a join where a table is joined with itself. It is useful for comparing rows within the same table.SELECT e1.EmployeeID, e1.FirstName, e2.ManagerID, e2.FirstName AS ManagerName
FROM Employees e1
INNER JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID; Indexing: Ensure the columns used in the ON clause are indexed to improve performance. Use Aliases: Use table aliases for better readability, especially in complex queries. Filter Early: Apply WHERE conditions as early as possible to reduce the number of rows processed by the join. Avoid Cartesian Products: Be cautious with CROSS JOIN as it can generate a large number of rows. Understand NULL Handling: Be aware of how LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL joins handle NULL values in unmatched rows. JOIN operations are fundamental for working with relational databases and combining data from multiple tables.
Choosing the right type of JOIN (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS) depends on the specific requirements of your query.
Understanding how each JOIN works helps you write efficient and accurate SQL queries.

An index acts like a lookup table that allows the database engine to quickly locate specific rows without scanning the entire table.Proper indexing strategies are essential for maintaining optimal database performance, especially as data volumes grow. However, improper use of indexes can degrade performance and increase storage overhead.
An index is a data structure that provides quick access to rows in a table.
Indexes are created on one or more columns to facilitate faster retrieval of data.
Think of an index like an index in a book, which helps you quickly find information without reading every page. An index on a single column.
Useful for queries that filter or sort based on a single column.
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_lastname ON Employees (LastName); An index on multiple columns.
Useful when queries filter or sort by more than one column.
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_department_lastname ON Employees (DepartmentID, LastName); Ensures that the indexed column(s) contain only unique values.
Automatically created with a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint.
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_email ON Employees (Email); Determines the physical order of data in a table.
Each table can have only one clustered index.
Typically created on the primary key.
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_employee_id ON Employees (EmployeeID); A separate structure that contains pointers to the physical rows.
A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_employee_salary ON Employees (Salary); Enables full-text search capabilities for textual data.
Useful for searching large text fields.
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX idx_employee_bio ON Employees (Bio); Create indexes on columns that are often used in: WHERE clauses
JOIN conditions
ORDER BY clauses
GROUP BY clauses CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customerid ON Orders (CustomerID); When queries filter by multiple columns, a composite index can improve performance.
The order of columns in the index matters.
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON Orders (CustomerID, OrderDate); This index benefits queries like:
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE CustomerID = 123 AND OrderDate &gt; '2024-01-01'; Clustered Index: Best for columns with unique, sequential values (e.g., primary keys).
Non-Clustered Index: Best for columns with frequent lookups but non-sequential values.
Unique Index: For ensuring data integrity on unique fields (e.g., email addresses). Too many indexes can: Slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Increase storage requirements. Only create indexes that benefit frequent queries. Index columns with high selectivity (columns with many distinct values).
Avoid indexing low-selectivity columns (e.g., columns with few unique values like Gender). An index that contains all the columns needed for a query.
Reduces the need for the database to access the table itself.
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_covering ON Orders (CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount); This index covers queries like:
SELECT CustomerID, OrderDate, TotalAmount
FROM Orders
WHERE CustomerID = 123; Index only a subset of rows based on a condition.
Supported in some databases like PostgreSQL.
CREATE INDEX idx_active_customers ON Customers (LastName) WHERE IsActive = TRUE; Regularly monitor index usage with database tools.
Use commands like EXPLAIN (MySQL) or EXECUTION PLAN (SQL Server) to analyze query performance.
Periodically rebuild or reorganize indexes to maintain efficiency. Write Performance: Indexes can slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) because the index needs to be updated. Query Optimization: Use EXPLAIN or QUERY PLAN to check if your queries are using indexes. Storage Overhead: Each index consumes additional storage.
Balance the number of indexes with performance needs. Index Fragmentation: Over time, indexes can become fragmented.
Regularly rebuild or reorganize indexes to optimize performance. Small Tables: Indexes on small tables may not improve performance significantly. Frequently Updated Columns: Columns that are frequently updated can degrade performance if indexed. Low Selectivity Columns: Columns with a small number of unique values (e.g., Gender, Status) may not benefit from indexing. Index frequently queried columns.
Use composite indexes for multi-column filters.
Balance the number of indexes to avoid write overhead.
Regularly monitor and maintain indexes.

This makes your SQL queries more modular, readable, and easier to maintain.WITH cte_name (optional_columns) AS ( subquery_definition
)
SELECT * FROM cte_name; cte_name: The name of the temporary result set (CTE).
optional_columns: An optional list of column names for the CTE.
subquery_definition: The query that defines the CTE.
WITH HighSalaryEmployees AS ( SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Salary &gt; 50000
)
SELECT * FROM HighSalaryEmployees; Explanation:
The HighSalaryEmployees CTE stores employees with a salary greater than 50,000. The final SELECT query retrieves all employees from this temporary result set. Improved Readability: CTEs allow you to break down complex queries into smaller, manageable parts. Reusability: You can reference the same CTE multiple times within a query. Recursion: CTEs can be recursive, allowing you to work with hierarchical or tree-structured data. Avoiding Subquery Repetition: Instead of repeating the same subquery, define it once using a CTE. Recursive CTEs allow you to perform operations on hierarchical data, such as organizational charts or parent-child relationships.WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS ( -- Anchor member (base case) SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, FirstName, 1 AS Level FROM Employees WHERE ManagerID IS NULL UNION ALL -- Recursive member SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID, e.FirstName, eh.Level + 1 FROM Employees e JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.ManagerID = eh.EmployeeID
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy; Explanation:
This query retrieves an employee hierarchy starting from top-level managers and recursively includes their subordinates.
You can define multiple CTEs in a single query.WITH SalesByRegion AS ( SELECT Region, SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales FROM SalesData GROUP BY Region
),
TopRegions AS ( SELECT Region FROM SalesByRegion WHERE TotalSales &gt; 100000
)
SELECT s.*
FROM SalesData s
JOIN TopRegions t ON s.Region = t.Region; Explanation: SalesByRegion: Aggregates total sales by region.
TopRegions: Filters regions where total sales exceed 100,000.
The final query joins the original SalesData with TopRegions to get detailed sales information for high-performing regions. Use CTEs for Complex Queries: Break down complex queries into multiple CTEs to enhance clarity. Optimize Performance: CTEs may be materialized (evaluated once) or inlined (evaluated as needed) depending on the SQL engine. Recursive CTEs for Hierarchies: Use recursive CTEs for hierarchical data like organizational charts or file systems. The WITH clause (CTE) is a powerful tool in SQL for improving query readability, reusability, and supporting recursion.
Combining CTEs with window functions, subqueries, and advanced SQL techniques can make your data analysis and query logic more efficient and maintainable.

본 문서는 MySQL 등 데이터베이스 환경에서 선택 항목을 효율적으로 관리하고 검색하는 방법 중 하나인 비트연산(bit operation)에 대해 다룹니다.
LIKE, OR 등을 사용하는 전통적인 검색 방식 대비 높은 성능 향상과 간단한 쿼리 구조를 제공하는 비트연산 접근법의 이점과 활용 방법을 소개합니다. 비트연산은 데이터를 2진수 형태로 처리할 때, 각 비트 단위로 연산을 수행하는 기법입니다.
흔히 사용하는 비트연산자는 다음과 같습니다. AND (&amp;): 두 비트가 모두 1일 때 1을 반환
OR (|): 두 비트 중 하나라도 1이면 1을 반환
XOR (^): 두 비트 중 하나만 1일 때 1을 반환
NOT (~): 비트를 반전 (1은 0으로, 0은 1로) 비트연산은 단순한 정수 연산보다 빠르고, 문자열 비교 등의 연산보다 훨씬 더 효율적입니다.
데이터베이스에서 AND (&amp;) 연산을 통해 특정 비트 패턴을 빠르게 필터링함으로써 LIKE나 OR 연산보다 높은 성능을 얻을 수 있습니다.
예를 들어, 다중 선택 가능한 항목 A~P까지 총 16개가 있다고 가정합니다.
각 항목에 고유한 2진 비트를 할당합니다. 예:
A: 0000 0000 0000 0001 (10진수: 1)
B: 0000 0000 0000 0010 (10진수: 2)
C: 0000 0000 0000 0100 (10진수: 4)
D: 0000 0000 0000 1000 (10진수: 8)
E: 0000 0000 0001 0000 (10진수: 16)
F: 0000 0000 0010 0000 (10진수: 32)
G: 0000 0000 0100 0000 (10진수: 64)
H: 0000 0000 1000 0000 (10진수: 128)
I: 0000 0001 0000 0000 (10진수: 256)
J: 0000 0010 0000 0000 (10진수: 512)
K: 0000 0100 0000 0000 (10진수: 1024)
L: 0000 1000 0000 0000 (10진수: 2048)
M: 0001 0000 0000 0000 (10진수: 4096)
N: 0010 0000 0000 0000 (10진수: 8192)
O: 0100 0000 0000 0000 (10진수: 16384)
P: 1000 0000 0000 0000 (10진수: 32768) 여러 항목을 동시에 선택할 경우, 각 항목의 값을 더한(OR 연산과 동일한 결과) 10진수 값을 DB에 저장합니다. 예: A(1) + B(2) = 3 (2진수로 0000 0000 0000 0011)
A(1) + D(8) + E(16)을 선택하면 1+8+16=25 (2진수로 0000 0000 0001 1001) 모든 항목을 선택하면 1+2+4+8+...+32768 = 65535 (2진수로 1111 1111 1111 1111) 특정 값들이 포함된 필드를 검색할 때, 전통적인 방법은 다음과 같이 LIKE와 OR을 혼합하여 사용합니다. 예: 값 2 혹은 5를 포함하는 레코드를 찾을 때
WHERE 필드 LIKE '%2|%' OR 필드 LIKE '%5|%' 이러한 LIKE + OR 쿼리는 문자열 검색이며, 인덱스 활용이 어렵고 성능 저하를 야기합니다. 데이터베이스에 25(0000 0000 0001 1001)가 저장되어 있다고 가정합니다. 이는 A(1), D(8), E(16)가 선택되었다는 의미입니다. A, B, C 중 하나라도 포함하는 레코드를 찾으려면 A(1)+B(2)+C(4)=7을 활용합니다.
SELECT * FROM 테이블 WHERE 필드 &amp; 7 &gt; 0; 필드 &amp; 7 연산 결과로 0보다 큰 값이 나오면, 필드 내에 A, B, C 중 하나 이상이 포함됨을 의미합니다.
필드(25) AND 7:
0000 0000 0001 1001 (25)
&amp; 0000 0000 0000 0111 (7)
----------------------- 0000 0000 0000 0001 (1, 이는 0보다 큼) 따라서 해당 레코드는 조건에 부합합니다. D(8)와 E(16) 모두를 포함한 레코드를 찾고 싶다면 8+16=24입니다. 단순히 필드 &amp; 24 &gt; 0으로는 D나 E 중 하나만 포함해도 성립합니다. 두 비트를 모두 포함하는지 확인하려면 bit_count() 함수를 활용할 수 있습니다.
SELECT * FROM 테이블 WHERE BIT_COUNT(필드 &amp; 24) = 2; 필드(25) AND 24:
0000 0000 0001 1001 (25)
&amp; 0000 0000 0001 1000 (24)
----------------------- 0000 0000 0001 1000 (24) 이 값의 비트 1의 개수는 2개이므로 D와 E 모두 선택되었음을 알 수 있습니다. 기존 쿼리:
WHERE 필드 LIKE '%A%' OR (필드 LIKE '%D%' AND 필드 LIKE '%E%') 비트연산 쿼리:
SELECT * FROM 테이블
WHERE 필드 &amp; 1 &gt; 0 -- A 포함 OR BIT_COUNT(필드 &amp; 24) = 2; -- D와 E 모두 포함 이렇게 비트연산을 활용하면 WHERE 조건문을 훨씬 단순화하고, 문자열 기반 검색보다 빠른 검색을 구현할 수 있습니다.&lt;?php
$aMultiSelect = Array( "1"=&gt;"A","2"=&gt;"B","4"=&gt;"C","8"=&gt;"D", "16"=&gt;"E","32"=&gt;"F","64"=&gt;"G","128"=&gt;"H", "256"=&gt;"I","512"=&gt;"J","1024"=&gt;"K","2048"=&gt;"L", "4096"=&gt;"M","8192"=&gt;"N","16384"=&gt;"O","32768"=&gt;"P"
);
echo "&lt;form method='post' action='2.php'&gt;";
foreach ($aMultiSelect as $sKey =&gt; $sVal) { echo "&lt;input type='checkbox' name='multiselect[]' value='$sKey'&gt;$sVal&lt;br /&gt;";
}
echo "&lt;input type='submit' value='submit'&gt;";
echo "&lt;/form&gt;";
?&gt; 위 예제에서 사용자는 체크박스를 통해 A~P를 다중 선택할 수 있습니다.
&lt;?php
$sSum = 0;
foreach ($_POST['multiselect'] as $sVal) { $sSum += $sVal;
}
// $sSum 값을 DB에 저장. 예를 들어 A, D, E를 선택하면 $sSum = 25
?&gt; 사용자가 선택한 항목 값을 모두 더한 값을 DB 필드에 저장합니다. 이는 비트마스크 형태로 선택 상태를 기록하는 것입니다. 속도 향상: 문자열 비교(LIKE)나 복잡한 조건(OR 조합)보다 비트연산이 훨씬 빠릅니다. 쿼리 단순화: 복잡한 조건문의 단순화로 유지보수가 용이해집니다. 확장성: 비트 수를 늘려 나가면 선택 옵션을 확대하는 데 어려움이 없습니다. (1비트 당 1개 항목) 항목이 매우 많아 비트 수가 커질 경우 정수 범위에 유의해야 합니다.
DB 자료형(예: UNSIGNED INT)을 적절히 선택하십시오.
BIT_COUNT 함수나 비트연산 최적화 전략을 적절히 활용하십시오.

It is similar to an IF-THEN-ELSE structure in other programming languages and is particularly useful for creating dynamic columns, conditional aggregations, and complex filtering.CASE expression WHEN value1 THEN result1 WHEN value2 THEN result2 ELSE default_result
END expression: The column or expression to evaluate.
WHEN: Specifies the condition to match.
THEN: Specifies the result if the condition is met.
ELSE: (Optional) The default result if none of the conditions are met.
END: Marks the end of the CASE statement.
CASE WHEN condition1 THEN result1 WHEN condition2 THEN result2 ELSE default_result
END Instead of matching an expression, the WHEN clause contains a full condition.
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, DepartmentID, CASE DepartmentID WHEN 1 THEN 'Sales' WHEN 2 THEN 'Engineering' WHEN 3 THEN 'HR' ELSE 'Other' END AS DepartmentName
FROM Employees; Explanation: The CASE statement converts DepartmentID values to their corresponding department names.
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, Salary, CASE WHEN Salary &gt; 80000 THEN 'High Salary' WHEN Salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 80000 THEN 'Medium Salary' ELSE 'Low Salary' END AS SalaryCategory
FROM Employees; Explanation: The CASE statement categorizes employees based on their salary ranges.
SELECT *
FROM Orders
WHERE CASE WHEN OrderDate &gt;= '2024-01-01' THEN 'Recent' ELSE 'Old' END = 'Recent'; Explanation: Filters orders where the order date is recent (after January 1, 2024).
SELECT ProductID, ProductName, Category, Price
FROM Products
ORDER BY CASE Category WHEN 'Electronics' THEN 1 WHEN 'Clothing' THEN 2 ELSE 3 END; Explanation: Orders products based on the Category column, with Electronics listed first, followed by Clothing, and then others.
SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(CASE WHEN Gender = 'Male' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS MaleCount, COUNT(CASE WHEN Gender = 'Female' THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS FemaleCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY DepartmentID; Explanation: Counts male and female employees in each department by conditionally counting rows based on gender.
You can nest CASE statements to handle more complex conditions.SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, Salary, CASE WHEN Salary &gt; 80000 THEN 'High' WHEN Salary &gt; 50000 THEN CASE WHEN Salary &lt;= 70000 THEN 'Medium-High' ELSE 'Medium' END ELSE 'Low' END AS SalaryCategory
FROM Employees; Explanation: This CASE statement categorizes salaries into more detailed categories using nested conditions. Readable Conditions: Keep WHEN conditions readable and straightforward to improve query clarity. Default Values: Always provide an ELSE clause to handle unexpected values and avoid NULL results. Performance Consideration: Complex CASE statements can impact performance. Optimize by simplifying conditions where possible. Consistent Data Types: Ensure all THEN and ELSE results return the same data type to avoid type conversion errors. The CASE statement is a versatile tool for introducing conditional logic in SQL queries.
It can be used in SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and aggregate functions to handle a wide range of dynamic scenarios.
Understanding CASE statements allows you to write more powerful and flexible SQL queries.

🖐️ Hello, I'm Yang-ha Park, a Process Technology Engineer pursuing innovation through data analysis and IT technology.
Throughout my career, I have: As an engineer with a humanities background, I've consistently improved company processes and quality by combining humanistic thinking with engineering knowledge, viewing problems from diverse perspectives through continuous learning and contemplation.
Created foundations for collecting reliable data, properly analyzing accumulated data to suggest company directions, and building evidence to solve problems.
Developed intuitive problem identification abilities through extensive field experience. I always remain vigilant in discovering and improving unreasonable practices disguised as conventions and customs.
Avoid focusing solely on quantitative results when prioritizing work. I approach tasks with rational skepticism to identify the fundamental root of truly significant and urgent 'existing problems' without getting lost in numbers and data alone. <img alt="Pasted image 20241204183153.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/settings/attachments/pasted-image-20241204183153.png" target="_self" style="width: 700px; max-width: 100%;">
"The process of breaking existing paradigms and finding reality" - these activities are recorded in history as 'innovation'. I constantly think and contemplate to find the threads of innovation.

🖐️ 안녕하세요. 데이터 분석과 IT 기술을 통해 혁신을 추구하는 공정기술 엔지니어 박양하입니다.
저는 그동안, 인문학 베이스의 엔지니어로서 인문학적 사고와 엔지니어링 지식을 융합해 다양한 관점에서 문제를 바라보고, 끊임없는 학습과 고민으로 회사의 공정과 품질을 꾸준히 개선해왔습니다.
신뢰할 수 있는 데이터를 수집할 수 있는 기반을 마련하고, 축적한 데이터를 올바르게 분석하여 회사의 방향성을 제시하고, 문제를 해결할 수 있는 근거를 만들어 나갑니다.
오랜 현장 경험을 통해 문제를 직관적으로 파악할 수 있는 능력을 갖췄습니다. 인지하기 어려운 불합리를 발견하고 개선하기 위해 항상 주의를 기울입니다.
일의 우선 순위를 정량적 성과 위주로만 치중하지 않습니다. 숫자와 데이터에만 매몰되지 않고 정말로 중대하고 긴급한 ‘실존하는 문제의 근본’을 파악하기 위해 항상 합리적인 회의주의를 가지고 업무에 임합니다. <img alt="Pasted image 20241204183153.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/settings/attachments/pasted-image-20241204183153.png" target="_self" style="width: 700px; max-width: 100%;">”측정할 수 없는 건 관리할 수 없다는 생각은 잘못 됐다. 그건 값비싼 신화다.” - W. Edwards Deming
”기존의 패러다임을 깨고 실체를 찾는 과정”, 이런 활동들이 역사에 ‘혁신’으로 기록됩니다. 혁신의 실마리를 찾기 위해 항상 고민하고 생각합니다.
아래에서 제가 실무에서 공정과 품질을 개선하기 위해 활용한 IT기술들과 제가 직접 기획하고 추진했던 프로젝트에 대해 간단히 소개 드리겠습니다. 귀한 시간을 내주셔서 정말 감사합니다!

SQL은 따로 정리해 둔 문서가 있다. &nbsp;핵심 개념 이해
&nbsp;실습 코드 실행 및 분석
&nbsp;추가 자료 조사 배운 점:
추가 조사를 통해 SQL의 구조를 한 번 다시금 훑어 보는 계기가 되었다.
느낀 점:
적당히 쓰는 건 어렵지 않은데, 잘 쓰긴 어려운 SQL…
다음에 개선할 점:
BigQuery에서 Indexing 테스트를 해봐야 겠다.

2024-12-7 Google BigQuery 데이터를 Pandas로 분석하는 방법을 이해한다.
각종 마케팅 데이터 분석 기법을 이해한다. 핵심 내용: Pandas 기본 사용법 Series와 DataFrame 생성
s = pd.Series([1, 3, 5, np.nan, 6, 8]) # Series 생성
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(6, 4), columns=['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']) # DataFrame 생성 데이터 확인 head(), tail()로 데이터의 처음과 끝 확인
df.head()
df.tail() 딕셔너리로 DataFrame 생성
df_dict = pd.DataFrame({ 'A': 1., 'B': pd.Timestamp('20130101'), 'C': pd.Series(1, index=list(range(4)), dtype='float32'), 'D': np.array([3]*4, dtype='int32'), 'E': pd.Categorical(['test', 'train', 'test', 'train']), 'F': 'str'

&nbsp;실습 코드 실행 및 분석
&nbsp;추가 자료 조사 배운 점:
마케팅 분석에 사용하는 여러 가지 기법에 대한 이해도가 생겼다.
느낀 점:
구글 클라우드를 이전에 사용해 본 적이 있어서 BigQuery 연동은 어렵지 않았다. 다만 BigQuery를 연결 확인하는 과정에서 강의 화면에 처음 보는 테이블이 연결되어 있길래 내가 강의를 대충 봐서 뭔갈 놓친 줄 알고 그전 강의를 다 돌려봤다. 결국 찾지 못하고 아무 테이블이나 연결해서 연동 테스트를 했는데 나중에 해당 테이블 주소를 강사님이 고치시더라… 또 몰려오는 피로감.

Plotly 라이브러리의 데이터를 시각화 기능을 이해한다. 데이터를 조회하고 정렬하는 방법입니다. Indexing: 특정 행과 열을 선택합니다. .loc[]: 라벨 기반 선택 .iloc[]: 정수 기반 선택 Sorting: 데이터를 정렬합니다. .sort_values(): 특정 열을 기준으로 정렬 .sort_index(): 인덱스를 기준으로 정렬 import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame({ "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], "Age": [25, 30, 35], "City": ["Seoul", "Busan", "Incheon"]
}) # Indexing
print(df.loc[0]) # 라벨 기반
print(df.iloc[1]) # 정수 기반 # Sorting
df_sorted = df.sort_values(by="Age", ascending=False)
print(df_sorted) 조건에 맞는 데이터를 추출합니다. Boolean Indexing: 조건을 만족하는 행만 필터링 복합 조건: &amp; (AND), | (OR), ~ (NOT) 연산 사용 # Age가 30 이상인 데이터 필터링
filtered = df[df["Age"] &gt;= 30] # 복합 조건
filtered_multiple = df[(df["Age"] &gt; 25) &amp; (df["City"] == "Busan")] print(filtered)
print(filtered_multiple) 날짜 및 시간 데이터를 다루는 기능입니다. 날짜 변환: pd.to_datetime() 날짜 연산: 날짜 간 차이 계산 날짜 속성: .dt로 연, 월, 일 추출 df["Date"] = ["2024-01-01", "2024-06-07", "2024-12-31"]
df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Date"]) # 날짜에서 연도 추출
df["Year"] = df["Date"].dt.year print(df) 데이터를 그룹화하고 집계하는 기능입니다. 그룹화: .groupby()로 데이터를 그룹화 집계 함수: .sum(), .mean(), .count() 등 사용 df = pd.DataFrame({ "Category": ["A", "B", "A", "B"], "Value": [10, 20, 15, 25]
}) grouped = df.groupby("Category")["Value"].sum()
print(grouped) 여러 데이터프레임을 합치는 기능입니다. Concatenate: pd.concat()로 데이터프레임 연결 Merge/Join: .merge()로 특정 조건에 맞게 병합 df1 = pd.DataFrame({"ID": [1, 2], "Name": ["Alice", "Bob"]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({"ID": [1, 2], "Score": [90, 85]}) combined = pd.merge(df1, df2, on="ID")
print(combined) 데이터를 재구성하는 기능입니다. Pivot Table: .pivot_table()로 데이터 요약 Index, Columns, Values 지정 df = pd.DataFrame({ "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Bob"], "Subject": ["Math", "Math", "Science", "Science"], "Score": [90, 85, 95, 80]
}) pivot = df.pivot_table(index="Name", columns="Subject", values="Score")
print(pivot) 데이터 값과 결측치(NA)를 다루는 기능입니다. 결측치 확인: .isna(), .notna() 결측치 처리: .dropna(), .fillna()로 처리 df = pd.DataFrame({ "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", None], "Score": [90, None, 85]
}) # 결측치 확인
print(df.isna()) # 결측치 채우기
df_filled = df.fillna({"Name": "Unknown", "Score": 0})
print(df_filled) Plotly는 인터랙티브한 차트를 만들 수 있는 파이썬 데이터 시각화 라이브러리입니다. 웹 기반의 그래프를 생성하며, 줌, 팬, 호버 등과 같은 상호작용 기능을 제공합니다.
import plotly.graph_objects as go fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3, 4], y=[10, 11, 12, 13], mode='lines'))
fig.update_layout(title='Line Chart Example')
fig.show()
import plotly.graph_objects as go fig = go.Figure(data=go.Bar(x=['A', 'B', 'C'], y=[10, 20, 30]))
fig.update_layout(title='Bar Chart Example')
fig.show()
import plotly.graph_objects as go fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(x=[1, 2, 3, 4], y=[10, 15, 13, 17], mode='markers'))
fig.update_layout(title='Scatter Plot Example')
fig.show() Plotly Express는 Plotly의 간단한 인터페이스로, 한 줄로 다양한 차트를 만들 수 있습니다.
import plotly.express as px # 선 그래프
fig = px.line(x=[1, 2, 3], y=[3, 1, 6], title='Line Chart with Plotly Express')
fig.show() # 막대 그래프
fig = px.bar(x=['A', 'B', 'C'], y=[4, 7, 2], title='Bar Chart with Plotly Express')
fig.show() &nbsp;핵심 개념 이해
&nbsp;실습 코드 실행 및 분석 배운 점:
그 동안은 주로 데이터베이스 GUI툴이나 BI 툴을 활용해서 데이터를 다뤘기 때문에 pandas로 데이터 전처리를 하고, 차트를 그리는 게 조금 불편했다. 그래도 몇 번 코드를 직접 쳐보니 조금 익숙해졌다.
느낀 점:
코드를 직접 치면서, 정확히 어떤 의도로 어떤 데이터를 연결 시키고 어떤 인사이트를 도출하겠다라는 명확한 설계를 구상하는 건 의외로 재미가 있었다.
다음에 개선할 점:
기능을 배우는 것보다 어떻게 응용 하는지가 더 중요하다. 강의를 들으면서 계속 아이디어를 떠올려 보면 어떨까 생각이 든다.

Attribution 분석 기법에 대해 이해한다.
Conversion Window 분석 기법에 대해 이해한다.
통합 마케팅 데이터 분석에 대해 학습한다. 제품 포트폴리오 분석은 기업이 보유하고 있는 여러 제품군의 성과를 체계적으로 분석하여, 각 제품의 수익성, 비용, 할인율 등을 평가하는 과정을 의미합니다. 이를 통해 효율적인 의사결정과 전략 수립을 지원합니다.
이 강의에서 제품 포트폴리오 분석은 다음과 같은 요소를 기반으로 이루어집니다: 수익성 분석 총 수익 (total_revenue): 제품 판매로 발생한 총 수익.
순이익 (total_net_profit): 총 수익에서 비용과 할인을 뺀 값.
순이익 비율 (net_profit_ratio): 순이익이 전체 수익에서 차지하는 비율로, 제품의 수익성을 나타냄. 비용 분석 총 비용 (total_cost): 제품을 생산하는 데 들어간 총 비용.
비용 비율 (cost_ratio): 비용이 전체 수익에서 차지하는 비율. 할인율 분석 총 할인액 (total_discount): 할인으로 인해 감소된 금액.
할인 비율 (discount_ratio): 할인이 전체 수익에서 차지하는 비율로, 마케팅이나 가격 전략 평가에 사용됨. 시각화를 통한 인사이트 도출 산점도 그래프를 통해 다음 요소들을 한눈에 파악할 수 있습니다: X축: total_revenue (총 수익)
Y축: net_profit_ratio (순이익 비율)
크기: total_net_profit (순이익)
색상: discount_ratio (할인율) 고수익 제품 식별 수익성과 순이익 비율이 높은 제품을 파악하여 집중 투자. 비용 효율성 평가 비용 비율이 높은 제품을 찾아 생산 비용 절감 전략을 수립. 할인 정책 최적화 할인율이 지나치게 높아 수익성이 저하된 제품을 조정. 제품 전략 수립 포트폴리오 전체를 평가하여 제품 개발, 마케팅, 가격 책정 등의 전략을 개선. 정의:
고객이 구매나 전환을 결정하는 과정에서 각 마케팅 접점이 얼마나 기여했는지 평가하는 기법입니다.
그룹별 최대값 인덱스 찾기:
df.groupby('group')['value'].idxmax()
df.loc[df.groupby('group')['value'].idxmax()] 정의:
고객이 제품이나 서비스를 처음 접한 후 전환(구매, 가입 등)을 완료하기까지 걸리는 시간을 측정하는 기법입니다.
온라인 쇼핑: 제품을 본 순간부터 구매까지의 시간
앱 사용: 앱 다운로드 후 첫 사용까지의 시간
서비스 가입: 서비스 가입 후 실제 사용 시작까지의 시간 전환 기간 계산:
df['pay_at'] = pd.to_datetime(df['pay_at'])

Python의 자료형을 이해한다.
조건문과 반복문을 이해한다.
예외처리를 이해한다.
Python 의 기초 라이브러리 ( Numpy, Pandas )를 살펴 본다. 파이썬은 동적 타입 언어로, 변수의 데이터 타입(자료형)을 명시적으로 선언하지 않아도 됩니다. 변수에 값을 할당하면 파이썬이 자동으로 데이터 타입을 결정합니다. 파이썬에서&nbsp;반복문과&nbsp;조건문은 프로그램의 흐름을 제어하는 데 필수적인 요소입니다. 반복문은 특정 코드를 여러 번 실행할 때 사용하며, 조건문은 특정 조건에 따라 코드 실행 여부를 결정합니다. 파이썬에서 함수와 클래스는 코드의 재사용성과 모듈화를 높이는 핵심 요소입니다. 함수를 사용하면 반복되는 작업을 하나의 블록으로 묶어 호출할 수 있으며, 클래스를 사용하면 객체 지향적 프로그래밍(OOP)을 구현할 수 있습니다. 설명:
특정 작업을 수행하는 코드 블록입니다. 필요할 때 호출하여 실행할 수 있습니다. 문법:
def 함수이름(매개변수): 수행할 작업 return 반환값 예제:
def greet(name): return f"Hello, {name}!" message = greet("Alice")
print(message) # Hello, Alice! 매개변수: 함수에 값을 전달할 수 있습니다.
반환값: return 키워드를 사용해 값을 반환할 수 있습니다.
재사용성: 동일한 로직을 여러 번 호출할 수 있습니다. 설명:
객체를 생성하기 위한 설계도입니다. 클래스에는 속성(데이터)과 메서드(함수)가 포함됩니다. 문법:
class 클래스이름: def __init__(self, 속성): self.속성 = 속성 def 메서드이름(self): 수행할 작업 예제:
class Dog: def __init__(self, name): self.name = name def bark(self): return f"{self.name} says woof!" dog1 = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog1.bark()) # Buddy says woof! 속성: 클래스 내에서 정의된 변수입니다.
메서드: 클래스 내에서 정의된 함수입니다.
생성자: __init__ 메서드를 사용해 객체 생성 시 초기값을 설정합니다.
객체 지향적 설계: 클래스는 데이터와 기능을 묶어 하나의 단위로 관리합니다. 파이썬에서 예외 처리는 프로그램 실행 중 발생할 수 있는 오류를 제어하고, 오류가 발생해도 프로그램이 종료되지 않도록 도와줍니다. 설명:
코드 실행 중 예외(에러)가 발생했을 때 이를 처리하여 프로그램이 비정상적으로 종료되지 않도록 합니다. 기본 문법:
try: # 예외가 발생할 수 있는 코드
except 예외종류: # 예외가 발생했을 때 실행할 코드
else: # 예외가 발생하지 않았을 때 실행할 코드
finally: # 예외 발생 여부와 관계없이 항상 실행할 코드 try: num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) result = 10 / num print(f"Result: {result}")
except ZeroDivisionError: print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
except ValueError: print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
else: print("Division successful!")
finally: print("Program execution completed.")
설명:
try: 예외가 발생할 가능성이 있는 코드 블록입니다.
except: 특정 예외가 발생했을 때 실행할 코드입니다.
else: 예외가 발생하지 않았을 때 실행되는 코드입니다.
finally: 예외 발생 여부와 관계없이 항상 실행되는 코드입니다. Numpy와 Pandas는 파이썬에서 데이터 처리를 위한 강력한 라이브러리입니다. 설명:
Numpy(넘파이)는 수치 계산을 위한 라이브러리로, 다차원 배열과 행렬을 효율적으로 처리할 수 있습니다. 주요 특징: 다차원 배열 (ndarray) 지원
벡터화 연산으로 빠른 계산
과학 계산 및 선형대수 지원 예제:
import numpy as np # 1차원 배열 생성
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr) # [1 2 3 4 5] # 배열의 기본 연산
print(arr * 2) # [2 4 6 8 10] <img alt="Pasted image 20241210145850.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/settings/attachments/pasted-image-20241210145850.png" target="_self"> 설명:
Pandas(판다스)는 데이터 분석과 처리를 위한 라이브러리로, 표 형식의 데이터를 쉽게 다룰 수 있습니다. 주요 특징: DataFrame과 Series 객체 제공
데이터 정리, 필터링, 변환 기능
CSV, Excel, SQL 등 다양한 데이터 소스와 호환 예제:
import pandas as pd # 데이터프레임 생성
data = { "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], "Age": [25, 30, 35], "City": ["Seoul", "Busan", "Incheon"]
} df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df) # 데이터 필터링
print(df[df["Age"] &gt; 28]) 출력 결과: Name Age City
0 Alice 25 Seoul
1 Bob 30 Busan
2 Charlie 35 Incheon <br> <img alt="Pasted image 20241210150126.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/settings/attachments/pasted-image-20241210150126.png" target="_self"> &nbsp;핵심 개념 이해
&nbsp;추가 자료 조사 배운 점:
파이썬의 기초를 오랜만에 다시 돌아 보았다.
느낀 점:
사실 대부분 아는 내용이라고 자만해서 강의를 대충 봤는데, 누가 질문을 한다고 가정하면 정확하게 대답할 자신이 없다.

print(df_sorted) 조건에 맞는 데이터를 추출합니다. Boolean Indexing: 조건을 만족하는 행만 필터링 복합 조건: &amp; (AND), | (OR), ~ (NOT) 연산 사용 # Age가 30 이상인 데이터 필터링
filtered = df[df["Age"] &gt;= 30] # 복합 조건
filtered_multiple = df[(df["Age"] &gt; 25) &amp; (df["City"] == "Busan")] print(filtered)
print(filtered_multiple) 날짜 및 시간 데이터를 다루는 기능입니다. 날짜 변환: pd.to_datetime() 날짜 연산: 날짜 간 차이 계산 날짜 속성: .dt로 연, 월, 일 추출 df["Date"] = ["2024-01-01", "2024-06-07", "2024-12-31"]
df["Date"] = pd.to_datetime(df["Date"]) # 날짜에서 연도 추출
df["Year"] = df["Date"].dt.year print(df) 데이터를 그룹화하고 집계하는 기능입니다. 그룹화: .groupby()로 데이터를 그룹화 집계 함수: .sum(), .mean(), .count() 등 사용 df = pd.DataFrame({ "Category": ["A", "B", "A", "B"], "Value": [10, 20, 15, 25]
}) grouped = df.groupby("Category")["Value"].sum()
print(grouped) 여러 데이터프레임을 합치는 기능입니다. Concatenate: pd.concat()로 데이터프레임 연결 Merge/Join: .merge()로 특정 조건에 맞게 병합 df1 = pd.DataFrame({"ID": [1, 2], "Name": ["Alice", "Bob"]})
df2 = pd.DataFrame({"ID": [1, 2], "Score": [90, 85]}) combined = pd.merge(df1, df2, on="ID")
print(combined) 데이터를 재구성하는 기능입니다. Pivot Table: .pivot_table()로 데이터 요약 Index, Columns, Values 지정 df = pd.DataFrame({ "Name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Bob"], "Subject": ["Math", "Math", "Science", "Science"], "Score": [90, 85, 95, 80]

final draft agreement We had a meeting this pas Monday to discuss some outstanding issues on the table.
They’re trying to play hardball.
Hopefully we’ll square away any remaining issues then. Hello, Yangha!
The sentences you said sound really good! Just a few minor adjustments and they'll be even more natural English sentences. In the first sentence,&nbsp;"By the end of two year.", you should say&nbsp;"two years"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"two year".
"Year"&nbsp;is a plural noun, so you need to use&nbsp;"years"! In the second sentence,&nbsp;"We need to negotiate for suppliers for hardware supplies.", you can remove&nbsp;"for"&nbsp;and say&nbsp;"We need to negotiate with suppliers for hardware supplies."&nbsp;It sounds more natural.
"Negotiate with"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"협상하다", and using&nbsp;"with"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"for"&nbsp;is a more natural expression. In the third sentence,&nbsp;"We have to delay all the schedule.", it would be better to say&nbsp;"We have to delay the whole schedule."&nbsp;In Korean,&nbsp;"all"&nbsp;is often used to mean&nbsp;"전체", but in English,&nbsp;"the whole"&nbsp;is more natural. In the fourth sentence,&nbsp;"I had a project to build database.", you need to add&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;before&nbsp;"database"&nbsp;to say&nbsp;"I had a project to build a database."&nbsp;"Database"&nbsp;is a countable noun, so you need to add&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;in front of it. In the last sentence,&nbsp;"They are not enough to build database by themselves.", you can replace&nbsp;"enough"&nbsp;with&nbsp;"sufficient"&nbsp;and say&nbsp;"They are not sufficient to build database by themselves."&nbsp;"Enough"&nbsp;should be used as an adjective, and&nbsp;"sufficient"&nbsp;is more natural as a noun. Yangha, if you carefully review each sentence and practice, you'll be able to develop even better English skills! By the end of the year
We need to negotiate for suppliers for hardware supplies.
→ We need to negotiate with suppliers for hardware procurement.
We have to delay all the schedule.
→ We need to delay all schedules.

회사 영어 프로그램의 일환으로 몇 개의 코스가 있었는데 그 중 Spicus 전화영어를 약 2달간 진행했다. 예전에도 전화영어를 해본 적이 있어서 그다지 낯선 시스템은 아니었다.
회사의 한국 법인 철수 결정으로 인해 예정되었던 3달을 못 채우고 코스가 종료됐지만 나름의 성과는 있었다고 생각한다. 일단 영어로 말할 기회가 너무 없다 보니 기억을 되살린 정도로도 만족한다.
코스는 Business Pro를 등록했고, 처음은 레벨 테스트를 진행하고 수업은 방식은 항상 정해진 포맷대로 진행하는 걸 골랐다. 이것 저것 사용자의 취향에 맞게 선택할 요소를 준다.
AI 시스템이 미리 예습을 도와주거나(발음 테스트 등), 수업 리허설을 진행해 보는 등 확실히 이전에 비해 많이 발전된 모습이었으나 실제로 적극적으로 활용하진 않았다. 암기노트, AI첨삭노트와 같은 기능이 있었는데 잘 활용하면 공부에 도움이 될 라고 생각한다.
강사는 모두 필리핀인으로, 전담 강사는 정해져 있었지만 강사에게 사정이 생길 경우 Sub-teacher가 배정 되었다. 정해진 형태의 수업을 진행하다 보니 수업의 질은 대체로 평이했다고 생각한다. 강사들은 Spicus 외에도 여러 교육 플랫폼과 계약된 것으로 보였다. 다들 굉장히 바쁜 느낌.
수업이 끝나면 보통 10분 내로 Feedback을 받을 수 있고, 이건 한글, 영어 양쪽으로 볼 수 있다. 한글본을 자세히 읽은 적은 없지만 오역은 거의 못 본 거 같다. 번역의 질이 상당하다.<br>

expand the business into
SWOT analysis
product line
investment opportunity The first item on the agenda is to discuss this SWOT analysis prepared by our analysts.
Do you have any thoughts on the information presented in the report?
Let’s set aside this topic for now and think about this a bit more before we make a final decision. Hello, everyone. Today, we’re here to explore ways to boost our smartphone sales in the U.S. The first item on our agenda is reviewing our pricing strategy. Next, we’ll discuss distribution channels—whether to switch, expand, or optimize them. Finally, we’ll talk about how to enhance our marketing efforts. Let’s start with the first topic: our pricing strategy. Do you have any thoughts on?
Q. When you hold meetings, which types of items do you generally like to discuss first? Why?A. I usually set the first item as either the most important or the most controversial topic to ensure everyone is focused right from the start. However, this approach can vary depending on the purpose of the meeting. For instance, if I know someone critical to the discussion won’t be able to join on time, I might postpone the important item until later. Ultimately, the order of the agenda depends on the specific circumstances and goals of the meeting.Q. Which items do you generally postpone for discussion later?A. The item that we need a time to figure out, or needed to research. If i judged that there are need of time for other people to figure out about the topic, I may postpone that for later. Well, I usually send attachments or references in advance to let them read that before coming on meetingHello, Yangha! After reviewing what you said, I think we can make some parts clearer.
The first sentence is perfect!&nbsp;"They were discussing product lines."&nbsp;It's a very natural and accurate expression. Let's look at the part&nbsp;"Our company's strength is high quality and power optimizer"&nbsp;in the second sentence.
If you change&nbsp;"power optimizer"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"power optimization."&nbsp;it will sound more natural.
"Our company's strength is high quality and power optimization."&nbsp;It would be better to say it like this, right? In the third sentence, it's more natural to use&nbsp;"inventory"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"inventories."&nbsp;"We have a lot of inventory in our warehouse."&nbsp;It would be much better to change it like this, right? You said the fourth sentence is&nbsp;"I might postpone the important item until later."&nbsp;It would be better to say it more naturally as&nbsp;"I might postpone the important item for later." In the last sentence, you said&nbsp;"If I am the first one to propose item I am afraid that others might things it is not important."&nbsp;You should use&nbsp;"think"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"things."&nbsp;And overall, it would be more natural to say&nbsp;"If I am the first one to propose the item, I am afraid that others might think it is not important." Yangha, after reviewing what you said today, I see that your English skills have improved a lot.
If you practice a little more, you'll be able to speak English more fluently.
Keep working hard in the future!

customer base In light of our current budget issues, we need to think about our options.
I like your idea of investing in social media advertisement, but I’m not sure I agree with decreasing our newspaper and TV ad costs.
It’s true that social media is a highly effective way to market, but don’t you think that we have to think about the older demographic as well? Q. Express your opinion to your coworkers. Say you disagree and explain why.A. Given our expanding business in China, I appreciate your suggestion to open an office in Beijing. However, I’m not entirely convinced about partnering with a local company. Don’t you think our presence in China is already strong enough? We also have many fluent Chinese speakers within our team, so a local partnership might not be necessary. Instead, we should focus on building strong relationships with key figures in the Chinese Communist Party.Q. Have you ever disagreed with your company’s business strategy? If so, in what ways, and why?A. I wouldn’t say I disagree with my company’s business strategy, but I often find myself at odds with people who prioritize their personal preferences over the bigger picture. In meetings, even when I prefer to stay quiet, I often feel compelled to voice my opinion that our product needs to be as perfect as possible. Business is like survival in a jungle—no, it’s even more complex than that. In business, the victim often doesn’t realize they’ve been swallowed by a giant predator until it’s too late.Q. Have you ever had a disagreement with a client? If so, why and how was it resolved?A. Situations like that can happen at any time. It might be related to design, functionality, or even user experience. While I don’t typically communicate with clients since my team’s work isn’t focused on customer care, if I do receive a customer complaint, I always strive to provide the best possible solution. First, I explain the reason behind the issue, and then I work on offering a reasonable solution that satisfies both sides. If that’s not possible, I usually propose an option that favors the client.Hello, Yangha!
Looking at the sentences you mentioned, I think a few small changes could make them sound more natural and clear. In the first sentence,&nbsp;"We still invest money on that.", it would be more natural to use&nbsp;"in"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"on".
"We still invest money "in" that."&nbsp;sounds much smoother.
In the second sentence,&nbsp;"I feel much on this sentence.", using an expression like&nbsp;"strongly"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"much"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"I feel "strongly" about this sentence." In the third sentence,&nbsp;"I will loss my job but i don't feel afraid on that.", using&nbsp;"lose"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"loss", and&nbsp;"about that"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"on that"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"I will "lose" my job but I don't feel afraid "about" that." In the fourth sentence,&nbsp;"My co-worker suggested to get a partnership to a local company.", using&nbsp;"to partner with"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"to get a partnership"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"My co-worker suggested "to partner with" a local company." In the last sentence,&nbsp;"We have many fluent Chinese speaker at our company.", you need to add&nbsp;"s"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"speaker"&nbsp;to make it plural.
"We have many fluent Chinese "speakers" at our company." You're doing really well, and I can see you're improving bit by bit.
Keep up the good work!

Making Suggestions]]></title><description><![CDATA[ benefits program
take a survey
high-end consumer I was looking into ways to improve our membership card.
While the initial idea to let everyone receive the same benefits is a good one, I think that it might be better to focus on one specific target group.
Why don’t we first take a survey of our competitors’ high-end consumer rewards programs? Q. Make a suggestion to your team at the meeting. Explain your reasoning in detail.A. I’ve been looking into ways to increase insurance sales and have a suggestion. a “Referral program”. It doesn’t simply means that giving temporary discounts to people who refer their friends. We’ll give special discounts on their monthly insurance payment. That would help build long-term loyalty, rather than just giving short-term perks.Q. At team meetings, do you consider yourself shy or do you speak up and make suggestions about ways to improve projects?A. I have a lot of ideas, and I want to achieve something meaningful in both my current projects and my career. I want to gain more experience, even if it sometimes leads to failure. I always tell myself, “One success is enough to change my life.” I might face challenges and fail, but as long as I don’t give up, I’ll grow stronger and eventually reach the top. That’s why I always share my opinions, even when others stay quiet. I understand they might be afraid of failing, but I’m willing to take the risk.Q. What types of suggestions would you make to the way in which your team operates?A. I would suggest getting rid of outdated customs that are no longer necessary. While we can improve our work by adopting better approaches, we can also make progress by reducing waste in our processes. This doesn’t mean I disregard the traditions we have; I believe there is valuable wisdom in them, and I aim to learn from that to create a better future. At the same time, I understand the importance of maintaining a relaxed work atmosphere because it helps people perform better. I’m not overly focused on efficiency alone, but it’s important to remember that a company’s primary goal is to make money—that’s the reason it exists. That’s why I prioritize efficiency above all else.Q. What would you improve about employee benefits at your company?A. I want to create a culture that people are excited to be a part of. In our workplace, we should share ideas openly, regardless of our position, and discuss ways to improve both our work environment and our lives. If we can make our work genuinely engaging and meaningful, the concept of “work-life balance” might not even feel necessary. I enjoy what I do, and I want others to feel the same way—instead of quietly complaining about the company. We have the power to change our circumstances, and I want everyone to realize that and be part of that change.
Hello, Ha Yang! Looking at the sentences you mentioned, I think a few minor edits can make them sound more natural and clear. The first sentence,&nbsp;"They discuss strategy on increasing insurance sales."&nbsp;is almost perfect, but using&nbsp;"for"instead of&nbsp;"on"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"They discuss strategy for increasing insurance sales"sounds better, right? It's a great sentence! The second sentence,&nbsp;"I suggest referral program."&nbsp;can be improved by adding&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;before&nbsp;"referral program."&nbsp;"I suggest a referral program"&nbsp;sounds much more natural. The third sentence,&nbsp;"Many people just want money."&nbsp;is correct, but how about using a more varied expression?&nbsp;"Many people are simply motivated by money"&nbsp;would be a richer and more natural expression. You're doing really well! With small adjustments, you'll develop perfect English skills.
I made a lot of mistakes today that I noticed while speaking. If I want to improve my English, I need to put myself in situations where I can speak it more often. I live in Nonsan, and I could use the excuse that there aren’t many opportunities to speak English here. But that’s just an excuse. I shouldn’t blame my environment—if I don’t like it, I know it’s up to me to change it.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/studies/spicus-english(2410~2411)/unit-14.-making-suggestions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Studies/SPICUS English(2410~2411)/Unit 14.

Running a meeting]]></title><description><![CDATA[ hang
time out
touch base Then we can figure out what we can do to fix the issue.
How can we figure out the answer to this question without any help?
That is the reason why I called this meeting. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining on short notice. We have an urgent matter to discuss today regarding the faulty design of our reclining chair, which has unfortunately caused injuries to a few customers. This is a serious issue, and our priority is to ensure customer safety while protecting our brand reputation. Let’s focus on identifying the problem, finding immediate solutions, and setting a timeline for resolution.
Before we start, let’s quickly go over the agenda for today’s meeting: Review the reported design issue and customer feedback.
Brainstorm potential immediate fixes and long-term solutions.
Discuss communication with affected customers.
Assign action items and propose a follow-up meeting to review progress. Does anyone have additional points to add before we dive in?
Q. How often do you have team meetings? What types of issues are usually discussed at those meetings?A. We hold regular meetings three times a week—on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays—where we primarily discuss issues related to the production line. Our focus is on manufacturing battery cells and BESS, and we’re always vigilant about preventing defects.Q. Have you had meetings with foreigners? If so, what types of issues have you had communicating?A. Our headquarters is in Israel, so the team there has a distinctive accent. As you know, we Koreans typically don’t have a noticeable accent, which sometimes makes communication challenging at first. However, once I get used to someone’s accent and pronunciation, it’s no longer an issue. Time takes care of everything.Q. How do you like to run your meetings? Formally? Informally? Who sets the agenda and how strictly do you stick to it?A. I usually hold meetings in a formal manner. I set the agenda in advance and share it with the attendees beforehand. I don't like wasting time in meetings, so I strive to keep them short and focused. To achieve this, I make sure to stick closely to the agenda.Hello, Yangha!
The sentence you said is really great! "It will be hold on Friday at 2:00 p.m. for status update."
Using "held" instead of "hold" in this sentence would be more natural.
"Be held" means "be held." while "hold" means "have." "It will be held on Friday at 2:00 p.m. for status update."
This correction makes it sound more accurate and smooth! Yangha, you will become more perfect as you continue to practice! You are making great progress!&gt;)

Let’s grab dinner sometime and catch up properly.
I’m afraid that I won’t be able to next week. Q. Have you attended any high school or college reunions? How was the experience?
What did you discuss with your former classmates? Did you share any fun stories or hear of any?
A. I dropped out of high school in my first year, and similarly, I also left college in my freshman year. After that, I attended two colleges in Australia, but now that I’m in Korea, it’s hard to meet the friends I made back then. I don’t keep in touch with anyone. Maybe I’m not someone who keeps a wide circle of connections.Q. Do you keep in touch with former colleagues? How often do you meet them? What do you talk about?A. I meet up with my former colleagues about once every few months. We usually drink together until we get wasted. And that’s all we do, Korean old men’s style. Of course, we have some conversation while drinking. Our topics are commonly works or trivial things we’ve done like as before.Q. What was the last conference or business-networking event that you attended? Did you meet any foreigners? If so, what did you discuss?A. I attended Microsoft’s AI Tour event about six months ago. I met a lot of people there, but we didn’t really have any in-depth discussions. I mostly just listened to the conference and joined in on the activities they had prepared. I went by myself, unlike many others who came with their colleagues as a team. Anyway, there were so many people from all around the world. But I wasn’t quite brave enough to approach them and start a conversation. It felt like I was the only one there on my own.Hello, Yangha! With just a few small changes, you can express yourself even more clearly.
The first sentence is almost perfect! Instead of&nbsp;"I'll call you back in the next week."&nbsp;it would be more natural to say&nbsp;"I'll call you back next week."
In the second sentence, instead of&nbsp;"Are you available on that time?", it should be&nbsp;"Are you available at that time?".
It's more natural to use&nbsp;"at"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"on."
In the last sentence, instead of&nbsp;"Where you stay?", it should be&nbsp;"Where do you stay?".
After&nbsp;"Where."&nbsp;you need to add&nbsp;"do"&nbsp;and before&nbsp;"stay"you need to add&nbsp;"you"&nbsp;to make a complete sentence.
Yangha, your English skills have improved so much! If you keep working hard, you'll become even more perfect!

I took a gamble thinking that if I took a taxi, I could make it to Grand Central on time.
I think I’d better take the subway. Q. What is the funniest story you have ever heard from a colleague? What was it about?A. It was Halloween recently. One of my friend was asked to attend a Halloween party in Seoul. And He was heard that the dress code is “black”. So he decided to wear black tights to make some fun. He thought other people may wear some kind of costume which fit for Halloween. And the day that the party held, he found that it wasn’t a party he expected. He saw everyone’s in black suit. I don’t know what happened the next, but my friend showed me a picture he took at that party. It was so weird, he stood around the people who’s in formal suits.
→ It was Halloween recently, and one of my friends was invited to a Halloween party in Seoul. He was told that the dress code was “black,” so, hoping to add a bit of fun, he decided to wear black tights, thinking everyone would show up in Halloween costumes.
But when he arrived at the party, it wasn’t quite what he’d expected. He looked around and realized everyone else was dressed in formal black suits. I’m not sure what happened next, but he showed me a picture from that night—it was hilarious! There he was, standing in a crowd of people in business attire, completely out of place in his costume.
Q. Have you had any interesting situations that occurred while traveling for business? What happened?A. I don’t have any. (kill joy)Q. At lunch, what do you discuss with your coworkers?A. We talked about the business documents of our company which address rules, procedures, and standards of our works. We all know that documents are not good enough, so we discuss how to make it better but we found that it’s really hard to change others, not us. And our roles are not making that kind of docs. So we ended up the talk saying our discussion will goes for nothing.
→ We talked about our company’s business documents that outline the rules, procedures, and standards for our work. We all agreed that these documents aren’t quite up to par, so we discussed ways to improve them. But we realized it’s tough to bring about change when it involves others, not just ourselves. Besides, creating these documents isn’t actually our responsibility. In the end, we wrapped up the conversation, admitting that our discussion probably wouldn’t lead to much.
Hello, Park Yangha/David!
Looking at the sentences you mentioned, I see that a few small adjustments could make them even more natural English sentences! In the first sentence,&nbsp;"It take me to two hours to get the hotel."&nbsp;you should change&nbsp;"It take"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"It takes.""It takes"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"it takes time,"&nbsp;while&nbsp;"take"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"to take up time,"&nbsp;so it was used incorrectly.
"to"&nbsp;indicates a&nbsp;"destination,"&nbsp;so changing it to&nbsp;"get to the hotel"&nbsp;would be more natural. In the second sentence,&nbsp;"There are so many bike driver."&nbsp;you should change it to&nbsp;"There are so many bike drivers."&nbsp;"driver"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"driver,"&nbsp;and the plural form is&nbsp;"drivers." The third sentence,&nbsp;"Maybe in the next year, I will go to Bohol."&nbsp;is well written, but it could also be written as&nbsp;"Maybe next year, I will go to Bohol."&nbsp;It's a simpler way to express it. In the fourth sentence,&nbsp;"Bohol is one of the best spot for scuba diving."&nbsp;you should change it to&nbsp;"Bohol is one of the best spots for scuba diving."&nbsp;"spot"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"place,"&nbsp;and the plural form is&nbsp;"spots." In the last sentence,&nbsp;"The taxi driver was waiting to me."&nbsp;you should change it to&nbsp;"The taxi driver was waiting for me."&nbsp;"waiting for"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"waiting,"&nbsp;so using&nbsp;"for"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"to"&nbsp;would be more natural. Good job, David! Keep practicing and you'll be able to write perfect English sentences.
I’m able to recognize my mistakes when I speak in English, I still omit “s”, use singular form very often. I understand how to use “s” in a proper way but it seems hard to get used to it. I want to count how many days will it take. As long as I achieve that, nothing matters.I can recognize my mistakes when I speak English, but I still often omit the ‘s’ and use singular forms.

over the phone I’m afraid that I won’t be able to next week.
I am booked solid with meetings and presentations for the next week or so. Q. Have you ever had issues with trying to meet with someone because of scheduling conflicts? How did you resolve those situations?A. I rarely encounter scheduling conflicts when it comes to business, but sometimes it’s challenging to meet my friends at a time when we can all get together. Unlike me, most of my friends are married, so they have their own families and need to take care of their children as well. This simply means that I have to adjust my schedule to fit theirs, but that’s no problem as long as we get to meet.Q. What type of software do you use to keep track of your meetings? Why?A. I use several Microsoft applications to manage my schedule and meetings, especially Teams, Planner, and Outlook. Our company provides licenses for these tools, and they’re quite effective for organizing my time and tasks. That said, I prefer Google Calendar for my personal life. With Google Assistant, I can easily add events by voice—like saying, ‘Hey Google, schedule a doctor’s appointment for this Saturday at 9 am’ It then reminds me when the time comes.Q. If an urgent issue came up and you had to reschedule a meeting, how would you handle the problem?A. I’ll inform the attendees as soon as possible and try to reschedule the meeting after addressing the urgent issue. If they’re unavailable at the new time, the meeting isn’t the only option—we can still discuss via email or chat. Another good option is holding a Zoom meeting. I typically have online meetings rather than in-person ones, as my company is international.Hello, Yangha! Looking at the sentences you wrote, I think a few adjustments would make them sound more natural in English. The first sentence,&nbsp;"I have only little vacation time."&nbsp;is almost perfect, but using&nbsp;"a little"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"little"&nbsp;would sound more natural.
Saying&nbsp;"I have only "a little" vacation time."&nbsp;makes it clearer that you have&nbsp;"little vacation time." The second sentence,&nbsp;"He always yell"&nbsp;would be more accurate with the addition of an&nbsp;"s"&nbsp;to the verb&nbsp;"yell."&nbsp;Saying&nbsp;"He always "yells"."&nbsp;means&nbsp;"He always shouts." The third sentence,&nbsp;"I bumped into my old friend who graduate from same elementary school."&nbsp;needs to change&nbsp;"graduate"&nbsp;to past tense.
Saying&nbsp;"I bumped into my old friend who "graduated" from the same elementary school."&nbsp;makes it clearer that you&nbsp;"bumped into an old friend who graduated from the same elementary school." The fourth sentence,&nbsp;"I was a bit discomfortable."&nbsp;needs&nbsp;"discomfortable"&nbsp;changed to&nbsp;"uncomfortable."&nbsp;Saying&nbsp;"I was a bit "uncomfortable"."&nbsp;means&nbsp;"I was a bit uncomfortable." The last sentence,&nbsp;"It is kind of waste of time."&nbsp;would be more accurate with an&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;before&nbsp;"waste."&nbsp;Saying&nbsp;"It is kind of "a" waste of time."&nbsp;means&nbsp;"It is kind of a waste of time." Yangha, it's great to see you working hard on your English studies! With a little effort, you'll be able to speak English more naturally and accurately. I'm cheering for you!

Let’s grab dinner sometime and catch up properly. Hello, Yangha! Looking at the sentences you wrote, I think a few adjustments would make them sound more natural in English. The first sentence,&nbsp;"I have only little vacation time."&nbsp;is almost perfect, but using&nbsp;"a little"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"little"&nbsp;would sound more natural.
Saying&nbsp;"I have only "a little" vacation time."&nbsp;makes it clearer that you have&nbsp;"little vacation time." The second sentence,&nbsp;"He always yell"&nbsp;would be more accurate with the addition of an&nbsp;"s"&nbsp;to the verb&nbsp;"yell."&nbsp;Saying&nbsp;"He always "yells"."&nbsp;means&nbsp;"He always shouts." The third sentence,&nbsp;"I bumped into my old friend who graduate from same elementary school."&nbsp;needs to change&nbsp;"graduate"&nbsp;to past tense.
Saying&nbsp;"I bumped into my old friend who "graduated" from the same elementary school."&nbsp;makes it clearer that you&nbsp;"bumped into an old friend who graduated from the same elementary school." The fourth sentence,&nbsp;"I was a bit discomfortable."&nbsp;needs&nbsp;"discomfortable"&nbsp;changed to&nbsp;"uncomfortable."&nbsp;Saying&nbsp;"I was a bit "uncomfortable"."&nbsp;means&nbsp;"I was a bit uncomfortable." The last sentence,&nbsp;"It is kind of waste of time."&nbsp;would be more accurate with an&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;before&nbsp;"waste."&nbsp;Saying&nbsp;"It is kind of "a" waste of time."&nbsp;means&nbsp;"It is kind of a waste of time." Yangha, it's great to see you working hard on your English studies! With a little effort, you'll be able to speak English more naturally and accurately. I'm cheering for you!

higly competitive Our core business focuses on the development, production and marketing of a broad range of pharmaceutical drugs.
We’re a major player in the domestic market, with limited presence in the global market.
We have a few drugs in the pipeline that are in the final phases of development. Hello, Yangha! These are good sentences! With a few small adjustments, you can speak even more naturally and clearly. The first sentence,&nbsp;"Our property is in Korea country."&nbsp;is almost perfect, but it would be more natural to say&nbsp;"South Korea"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"Korea country."&nbsp;"Korea"&nbsp;already means a country, so adding&nbsp;"country"&nbsp;can sound a little awkward.
So, saying&nbsp;"Our property is in South Korea."&nbsp;would sound more natural! In the second sentence,&nbsp;"Our business to make renewable energy accessible."&nbsp;you should change&nbsp;"to make"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"is to make."&nbsp;Saying&nbsp;"Our business is to make renewable energy accessible."&nbsp;would sound cleaner! In the last sentence,&nbsp;"Our stock market has been dropped."&nbsp;it would be more natural to use&nbsp;"declined"&nbsp;or&nbsp;"fallen"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"dropped."&nbsp;"dropped"&nbsp;gives a feeling of suddenly falling, while&nbsp;"declined"&nbsp;or&nbsp;"fallen"&nbsp;expresses a gradual fall.
So, saying&nbsp;"Our stock market has been declining."&nbsp;or&nbsp;"Our stock market has fallen."&nbsp;would sound more natural! Overall, you are doing really well! With just a few small adjustments, you can make your sentences perfect.
If you keep practicing, you will be able to speak English more naturally.

based in I’m sorry. Aloow me to introduce myself.
I work at the Korean company FastTradingCo as a Technology Advisor.
Pleased to meet you Hello, Yangha! If you make a few changes, your English sentences will sound more natural! In the first sentence, you should change&nbsp;"There is long waits"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"There are long waits."&nbsp;"Waits"&nbsp;is plural, so you need to use&nbsp;"are."&nbsp;"Between presentations"&nbsp;is fine.
So,&nbsp;"There are long waits between presentations, but the topics are interesting."&nbsp;is perfect! The second sentence should be changed to&nbsp;"Mary works at BestMobileCo as a software developer."&nbsp;You need to change&nbsp;"work"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"works"&nbsp;to make it consistent with the present tense! The third sentence should be changed to&nbsp;"If you are interested in art, I would like to recommend Seoul National Museum to you."&nbsp;You should use&nbsp;"interested in"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"interesting"&nbsp;and&nbsp;"would like to recommend"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"like to recommend."&nbsp;Adding&nbsp;"to you"&nbsp;makes it even better! The fourth sentence is almost perfect, but it would be more natural to say&nbsp;"They provide us with free meals"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"They give us free meals."&nbsp;Using&nbsp;"provide"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"give"&nbsp;and adding&nbsp;"with"&nbsp;makes it even better! In the last fifth sentence, you should change&nbsp;"I gave them sometime to finished their work correctly"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"I gave them some time to finish their work correctly."&nbsp;You need to use&nbsp;"some time"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"sometime"&nbsp;and&nbsp;"finish"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"finished"&nbsp;to make the tense consistent with&nbsp;"gave." Yangha, you are amazing for always trying to learn new things! With a little more practice, your English skills will improve even more!

Review - Working on Projects]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hello, Yangha! I'll tell you how to make the sentences you mentioned sound more natural.
The first sentence,&nbsp;"I experience typhoon too."&nbsp;would sound more natural as&nbsp;"I experienced a typhoon too."&nbsp;"Experience"&nbsp;is a verb that means to have something happen to you, so when you're talking about something that happened in the past, you need to use the past tense,&nbsp;"experienced."&nbsp;And&nbsp;"typhoon"&nbsp;is a natural phenomenon, so it's good to put&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;in front of it.
The second sentence,&nbsp;"We will have a global meeting next next week."&nbsp;can be simplified to&nbsp;"We will have a global meeting next week."&nbsp;"Next next week"&nbsp;is a common expression in Korean, but in English,&nbsp;"next week"&nbsp;is enough to convey the meaning.
The third sentence,&nbsp;"I think I had a lot of issues with outsourcing."&nbsp;is excellent! This sentence is perfect.
The fourth sentence,&nbsp;"Some of our sub-constructors provided with some effects."&nbsp;would sound more natural as&nbsp;"Some of our sub-constructors provided some effects."&nbsp;Using&nbsp;"provided"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"provided with"&nbsp;makes the sentence more concise and natural.
The last sentence,&nbsp;"We tried to figure out what is the real reason for the bad product."&nbsp;can be changed to&nbsp;"We tried to figure out the real reason for the bad product."&nbsp;Omitting&nbsp;"what is"&nbsp;makes the sentence more concise and natural.
Your English skills have really improved! With a little more practice, you'll be able to communicate perfectly in English.
Keep it up!

intradepartmental So far, the feedback has been positive.
There are a few things we need to iron out.
We’ll contact each of your departments to get the ball rolling on fixing these problems. Hello, Yangha! I see some areas where you can make your sentences sound more natural.
With a few small changes, you can make your writing clearer and more concise.
First sentence,&nbsp;"They don't have interest in my project."&nbsp;Instead of&nbsp;"interest."&nbsp;you can use&nbsp;"interested"for a more natural expression.
"They are not interested in my project"&nbsp;would be better.
Second sentence,&nbsp;"It is too spicy for them to general people."&nbsp;Instead of&nbsp;"general people."&nbsp;"the general public"&nbsp;is a more familiar expression, and instead of&nbsp;"for,"using&nbsp;"for them to be"&nbsp;makes the sentence smoother.
How about changing it to&nbsp;"It is too spicy for them to be comfortable with."?
Third sentence&nbsp;"We need to minimize the spicy taste."is great! You're doing well.
Fourth sentence,&nbsp;"They think computer do everything."Instead of&nbsp;"computer do."&nbsp;using&nbsp;"computers can do"makes the sentence more natural.
Try changing it to&nbsp;"They think computers can do everything."
Last sentence,&nbsp;"It is always hard to address issue to them."&nbsp;Using&nbsp;"address issues with them"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"address issue to them"&nbsp;is more natural, and changing&nbsp;"it is always hard"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"it's always difficult"&nbsp;makes it look cleaner.
How about changing it to&nbsp;"It's always difficult to address issues with them."?
Yangha, it's great to see your continuous efforts! With a little more practice, you'll become a perfect English speaker! Fighting!

This project is urgent, so we need a quick turnaround on setting up our website.
Would you be able to finish ahead of schedule? Hello, Yangha!
After reviewing the sentences you mentioned, I think they can be made even more natural with a few minor corrections! In the first sentence, "There not too many changes.", you need to add "are" after "There" to make it a complete sentence.
"There are not too many changes." sounds much more natural.
The second sentence, "They are not just useful but also necessary.", is perfectly correct! You did a great job! In the third sentence, "Database should be no malfunction.", it's more natural to use "malfunction-free" instead of "no malfunction".
"Database should be malfunction-free." sounds smoother. In the fourth sentence, "Our expectations for database shouldn't be too different.", it's better to add "the" before "database".
"Our expectations for the database shouldn't be too different." conveys the meaning more accurately. In the fifth sentence, "We have many contractors because we are manufacturing company.", it's better to change "manufacturing company" to "a manufacturing company".
"We have many contractors because we are a manufacturing company." makes for a more natural sentence. Yangha, with just a few grammatical tweaks, these are really great English sentences! Keep practicing and your skills will definitely improve! There not too many changes.
→ There aren’t too many changes.
They are not just useful but also necessary.
→ They’re not just useful but also essential.
Database should be no malfunction.
→ The database should be free of malfunctions.
Our expectations for database shouldn’t be too different.
→ Our expectations for the database shouldn’t differ too much.
We have many contractors because we are manufacturing company.
→ We have many contractors because we’re a manufacturing company.

at this point It seems like we’re going to have to push back the deadline.
The problem is that we don’t have much wiggle room with the deadline.
It’s best to have this project finished on time, no matter the cost. The sentences you said today are almost perfect! However, with a few minor adjustments, they can become even clearer and more natural English sentences. The first sentence, “Due to bad weather in contractor’s country, the deadline will be delayed.” is really well said! If you write “the contractor” instead of “contractor’s”, it will be even more perfect.
Adding “the” makes it clear that “contractor’s” refers to a specific contractor. The second sentence, “I think to that work for 2 days only.” sounds a bit awkward.
“I’ll work” is a more natural expression than “I think to that work”.
“I’ll work for 2 days only” is a complete sentence. The third sentence, “Some people doesn’t meet the requirement for work.” should be “don’t” instead of “doesn’t”. The fourth sentence, “I am still thinking about how should I do?” should be “to” instead of “should”. “I am still thinking about how to do?” sounds more natural. The last sentence, “It very complicated.” should be “It’s very complicated.” English sentences need a subject and a verb to be complete sentences. You’re doing really well! You seem to be very good at English, Yangha.
Keep practicing and you will be able to develop even more fluent English skills.

Answer: The assembly instructions are currently only available in Korean. We recognize the importance of making these accessible to our team in China and plan to have them translated into English as an intermediary step. This process is expected to take approximately one week. We will explore options for translation into Chinese to ensure clarity and accessibility for all team members involved in the assembly process. Question: Do we have visual aids, such as videos, to supplement the assembly instructions? Answer: At the moment, we do not have video documentation of the assembly process. However, we acknowledge the value of visual aids in enhancing understanding and reducing the potential for errors. We will initiate the creation of video tutorials that detail the assembly process, ensuring that these resources are comprehensive and easy to follow. Question: What specific assembly procedures are currently undertaken by the Korean CM, and are we fully aware of these processes? Answer: The Korean CM handles a range of assembly procedures that are documented in our standard operating procedures. However, it's essential to conduct a thorough review to ensure that all processes are fully captured and up-to-date. We are in the process of auditing these procedures to confirm their completeness and accuracy. Question: Considering the assembly procedures performed by the Korean CM, do we believe it's feasible to replicate these processes in China without significant obstacles? Answer: Based on our initial assessment, we believe that transitioning these assembly processes to China is feasible. The procedures do not require specialized skills that cannot be replicated or taught in China. However, we must ensure that all procedural documentation is current, translated, and adapted as necessary to meet any local regulatory requirements or operational differences. Question: Are there any anticipated challenges or limitations in transferring the assembly line to China, such as differences in regulations, standards, or workforce skills? Answer: While we anticipate a smooth transition overall, we are mindful of potential challenges such as differences in regulatory standards, the need for workforce training, and the adaptation of procedures to local practices. We are committed to conducting a detailed analysis to identify any such challenges early in the process and develop strategies to address them effectively. Question: What will be the approach if there are questions raised during the meeting that cannot be immediately answered? Answer: Should any questions arise that I cannot answer directly, I will take detailed notes and follow up with my direct manager to ensure a timely and accurate response. We are committed to transparency and effective communication throughout this transition process. Question: Do we need to translate the assembly instructions? Are there videos? Answer: Yes, the instructions are only in Korean now. We need to translate them into English, which will take about a week. We don't have videos yet, but we plan to make them to help everyone understand the process better. Question: Can we use the same assembly procedures in China as in Korea? Answer: The procedures we use in Korea can be used in China too. We don't see big problems with moving the assembly there. Most tasks don't need special skills. But, we need to update and translate our instructions to make sure everyone can follow them. Question: What problems might we face moving to China? Answer: We might face some challenges, like different rules or the need to train the team in China. But we believe we can handle these by planning well and updating our instructions. Question: How long will it take to get all the documentation ready for the China team? Answer: We need about one week to translate the current documents into English. Making videos and further translations might take a bit more time. Question: Will the training materials be understandable for someone who doesn't speak Korean? Answer: Yes, we will translate everything into English first, and then into Chinese if needed, to make sure everyone can understand. Question: How do we ensure the quality of the assembly process remains high after moving to China? Answer: We will train the China team using our updated guides and videos. We will also check the assembly quality regularly. Question: Are there any parts of the assembly that must stay in Korea? Answer: Right now, we think everything can move to China. But we will double-check to make sure. Question: What is our timeline for moving the assembly line to China? Answer: We are still planning, but we will share a timeline as soon as we have it. Question: How will we handle differences in work culture between Korea and China? Answer: We will learn about the work culture in China and adapt our training and management to fit well with the team there. Question: Do we need any special permissions or certifications to start manufacturing in China? Answer: We are checking on this. We will get all the needed permissions and certifications before we start. Question: How will we transfer equipment and materials to China? Answer: We are planning the best way to do this. We will make sure everything is safe and cost-effective. Question: What if we face unexpected challenges during the move? Answer: We will plan carefully and have backup plans. We will solve problems as they come. Question: How will we communicate with the team in China? Answer: We will use English for official communication. We might also use translators when needed to make sure everyone understands. Question: Will there be ongoing support from Korea to the China team? Answer: Yes, we will keep supporting the China team. We can have regular meetings and visits to make sure everything goes well. Question: How will this move affect our delivery times to customers? Answer: We plan to keep delivery times the same, or even improve them by being closer to some of our customers. ]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/studies/english/2024-02-05-questions-from-hq.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Studies/English/2024-02-05 Questions from HQ.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 05:46:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[emoji]]></title><description><![CDATA[제가 사용하는 아이콘은 주로 이모지 (Emoji)입니다. 이는 플랫폼에 상관없이 대부분의 환경에서 잘 보이고, 별도의 설정이나 플러그인 없이 마크다운 문서에 쉽게 삽입할 수 있습니다.✅ 작업 완료 ❌ 작업 실패 🚀 프로젝트 시작 💡 새로운 아이디어 📅 오늘 날짜: 2024-06-10 🔗 [링크](https://example.com) ✅ 작업 완료

Google Apps Script는 Google Workspace (예: Gmail, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Google Forms 등)와 함께 사용되는&nbsp;JavaScript 기반의 스크립트 언어이다. Google의 여러 서비스 및 앱을 자동화하고 확장하는 데 활용할 수 있다. 직접 코드를 작성할 수 있기 때문에 활용법은 무궁무진. <a data-href="Appsheet를 활용한 작업 일보 어플리케이션 최단기간 구현 - 1" href="https://64etuor.github.io/works/google/appsheet/appsheet를-활용한-작업-일보-어플리케이션-최단기간-구현-1.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Appsheet를 활용한 작업 일보 어플리케이션 최단기간 구현 - 1</a>

앱을 통해 엔드유저로부터 입력된 데이터를 기반으로 대시보드는 간단하게 Sheets로, 그리고 QR 제품 이력 조회는 Apps Script로 구현하면 호스팅 같은 번거로운 문제 없이 최단 기간 내에 원하는 모든 프로토타입을 만들고 시연해 볼 수 있다.
아이디어 검증과 향후 프로젝트의 방향성을 좀 더 구체화하기 위해 간단히 제품 이력이 조회되는 스크립트를 구현해 본다.//Code.gs function doGet(e) { var rackNo = e.parameter.rackNo; var config = getConfig(); var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.openById(config.SHEET_ID).getSheetByName(config.SHEET_NAME); if (!sheet) { return createErrorPage("Sheet not found.

Agile E-BoM Level 열 앞에 11개 열을 만들고 각 열의 이름을 0~10까지의 순서대로 나열, 그리고 Level의 숫자를 매칭되는 열에 입력.
M-BoM에서 사용하지 않는 열 삭제 및 필요한 열의 순서 정렬
특정 위치에 BLANK 열 추가
M-BOM.QTY 열 추가: E-BOM은 생산단위별 소요량이 나오지만 M-BOM은 제품을 만드는데 필요한 총 소요량이 필요함. 상위 Level 부품의 개수에 맞추어 하위 Level 소요량 재조정.(예를 들어 상위 Level 부품의 개수가 3이면 하위 Level 소요량에 3을 곱한 수량을 산출하여 입력, Level이 그보다 낮은 부품이 있다면 상위 Level의 소요량을 연속해서 곱해줌.)
M-BOM.E/EP/SC 열 추가: Level 계층 구조에 따라 부품의 구매/도급/직접생산 여부를 결정. Buy/Make 열 값이 Buy인&nbsp;항목을 열 위에서 아래 방향으로 찾고&nbsp;현재 레벨이 부모 레벨과 같거나 낮으면 M-BOM.E/EP/SC&nbsp;열에&nbsp;E&nbsp;값을 할당. 그리고 부모 레벨을 현재 레벨로 업데이트.
부모 레벨의 Buy/Make 열 값이 Make&nbsp;이고&nbsp;현재 행의 레벨이 부모 레벨과 같거나 낮을 때 부모 레벨을&nbsp;현재 레벨 + 1로 설정.
현재 행의 레벨이 부모 레벨보다 높으면서&nbsp;Buy&nbsp;항목이면, M-BOM.E/EP/SC&nbsp;열에&nbsp;EP&nbsp;값을 할당. 열 너비 조정

기존에 몇 시간씩 걸리던 작업이 이 모듈을 사용한 이후로는 5분도 걸리지 않았다. 다른 그룹에는 ‘M-BOM 작성만’ 담당하는 직원이 있다고 하는데 뭔가 머리가 띵한 기분이 든다.
처음에 로직 구현에 애를 먹어서 ChatGPT랑 한참 씨름을 하다가 결국엔 직접 구현한 좀 비효율적인 함수로 모듈을 만들었었는데, 이번에 이 글을 작성하면서 리팩토링을 했다.
익숙한 언어가 아니기에 이것저것 수정하고 고민하던 재미도 있었고, 어쨌든 새로운 언어를 배우면서 원하는 결과물을 구현하는, 꽤 재밌는 작업이었던 거 같다.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/works/microsoft/excel-vba/excel-vba_e-bom-to-m-bom-자동-변환-모듈.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Works/Microsoft/Excel VBA/Excel VBA_E-BOM to M-BOM 자동 변환 모듈.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2024 11:42:24 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ERP 대용 솔루션 최적화 및 핵심 기능]]></title><description><![CDATA[앱의 성능을 최적화할 수 있는 방법과 핵심 기능만 소개합니다.<img alt="Pasted image 20241209135038.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/settings/attachments/pasted-image-20241209135038.png" target="_self">
앱의 성능을 위해 Control과 Component의 수는 적을 수록 좋다. 계층 구조의 데이터나, 위와 같은 테이블 형태로 입력하는 게 유리한 형태의 데이터의 경우 Gallery Control 내부에 다른 Control을 삽입하여 출력하는 방법을 적극적으로 활용한다. (예: 사이드 메뉴 등)
(스프레드시트처럼 Grid 형태로 표시되는 위 사진의 테이블은 사실 Gallery Control에 텍스트 입력 컨트롤 등을 여러 개 삽입하고, 테두리를 적용한 눈속임에 불과하다.)

최종적으로 서버에 patch 하여 저장 해야 하는 데이터를 입력하는 경우, 입력 Control의 OnChange 속성에서 위와 같은 코드를 적용한다.
캐시에 콜렉션 형태로 데이터를 저장/업데이트하고 이후에 유저의 특정 조작으로 한번에 서버에 patch하는 게 핵심이다.
(개별 레코드로 patch할 경우, 서버 응답까지 감안하면 상당히 느릴 뿐더러 각 patch의 error에 대응해야 한다.)
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241209135719.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/settings/attachments/pasted-image-20241209135719.png" target="_self">
Component(한글판: 구성 요소)는 자체적으로 독립된 개체이다. 외부에서 선언한 변수나 Control의 값을 직접 참조하거나 변경할 수 없기 때문에 “사용자 지정 속성 기능”을 이용해서 속성(화면, 변수 등)을 명시하고 Component와 외부 요소 간 데이터 통신을 한다.
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241209140537.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/settings/attachments/pasted-image-20241209140537.png" target="_self">
Power Apps의 앱의 함수는 기본적으로 동기적으로 처리된다.
따라서 비동기처리가 필요한 경우 Concurrent 함수를 이용해서 명시적으로 처리해주어야 한다. 당연한 얘기지만 Concurrent 내의 각 함수는 서로 독립적이어야 한다.
대표적으로 Concurrent를 사용하는 예가 바로 “데이터 로드”, 혹은 위 사진의 “데이터 캐싱”이다.
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241209134814.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/settings/attachments/pasted-image-20241209134814.png" target="_self">
Gallery Control 등 데이터 조회 기능의 items 속성은 앱 로드 시 미리 캐싱된 콜렉션 데이터를 활용한다. 지연시간을 줄여 사용자 경험을 향상 시킬 수 있다.

위와 마찬가지로 앱 내에서 Lookup 함수 등으로 조회/필터 등이 필요한 정적 데이터도 미리 Collection 등으로 캐싱해 두는 게 바람직하다. <br><img alt="Pasted image 20241209141258.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/settings/attachments/pasted-image-20241209141258.png" target="_self">
어떻게 어플리케이션 내에서 Power BI의 데이터셋을 업데이트하는 작업을 수행할까 고민을 했었는데 굉장히 간단한 방법으로 해결했다.
위의 Commit Sign 프레임은 Sharepoint List와 연결되어 있고, Commit 버튼을 누르면 실제로는 폼을 제출하여 데이터가 저장되는 형태다.
Power Automate의 트리거를 바로 이 Sharepoint List에 새로운 레코드가 등록될 때로 지정하여, Power BI Rest Api를 호출하여 Dataset을 Refresh하는 플로우를 만들었다.<br>

기본 DropDown Control의 경우, 여러가지 항목을 동시에 선택하면 “다중 선택 값”이라고 표시되고 실제 선택된 항목을 직관적으로 알 수 없다.
이걸 해결하기 위해 Label을 하나 추가해서 DropDown Control의 Text 표시 부분에 오버랩하고 Concat 함수로 값을 붙여서 표시하게 했다. isBlank 결과에 따라 표시하는 결과가 다른 이유는, 서버에 저장된 값(레코드)은 키/값 쌍으로 이루어진 딕셔너리이고, 내부 형태는 id와 value로 이루어져 있으므로 Value를 표시한다. DropDown Control에 선택된 현재 값은 연결된 인사 정보 테이블의 데이터(DropDown Control의 Items source)이고, id, 이름, 사번 등의 데이터가 레코드 정보에 있기 때문에 ‘이름’을 표시한다. 마지막으로 전역 변수는 아래와 같은 특정 상황에서 제한적으로 활용하고 가급적이면 컨텍스트 변수나 컬렉션을 사용한다. 앱 전반에 걸친상태 관리(테마, 환경 설정 등) 개인화 설정을 지원하려는 경우, 별도의 DB 테이블로 관리한다.(Power Apps는 로컬 기기의 파일 시스템, 레지스트리, 설정 등과 직접적으로 상호 작용할 수 없다.) 화면 간 데이터 전달

그런데 텍스트로만 표현된 불량 내역은 직관적이지 못하다.
그래서 대시보드에서 바로 불량 사진을 확인할 수 있도록 구현하고자 했다.
우선 구현하고자 하는 기능과 Power BI, Sharepoint List의 기능을 점검했다.
대시보드 구현 어플리케이션: Power BI
데이터베이스: Sharepoint List (Dataverse나 SQL 등과 다르게 추가 비용이 발생하지 않음. 다만 데이터베이스로 사용하기엔 한계가 명확.) Power BI 대시보드에서 불량 사진을 바로 확인할 수 있는 기능 구현
(Power BI에서는 URL이 저장된 열이 있다면 Data Category를 변경하여 사진으로 출력하는 기능 있는 것으로 확인) Sharepoint List에 Image를 등록하면 레코드 형태로 저장되기 때문에 Power BI에서 바로 출력이 불가능 Sharepoint List에 Image가 등록/수정되면 Power Automate로 JSON을 파싱하여 이미지 URL 추출하여 imgURL이라는 열에 저장
Sharepoint 커넥터의 Get Attachments 액션을 활용하면 AbsoluteUri를 간단하게 추출할 수 있다. 아래는 커넥터에서 자체 지원하지 않는 경우(이 경우가 훨씬 많다.)를 위해 기록을 남겨둔다. <img alt="Pasted image 20241008132222.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008132222.png" target="_self"><br> <img alt="Pasted image 20241008132325.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008132325.png" target="_self">
Site Address: 파싱 대상 Sharepoint List의 주소 선택
Method: GET
Uri:
//'listName'에 Sharepoint List의 Internal Name을 넣어준다.
//items다음의 $orderby=Created desc&amp;$top=1 는 리스트의 항목 생성시간을 내림차순으로 정렬하고, 가장 상위의 값 1개를 가져오는 명령이다. /_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listName')/items?$orderby=Created desc&amp;$top=1
<br> <img alt="Pasted image 20241008134855.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008134855.png" target="_self"><br>

값을 살펴보면 “_metadata”: 내에 “uri”가 저장되어 있다.
그리고 “image”에 리스트 형태로 “fileName”이 저장되어 있다.
그 아래로 스크롤을 내리다 보면 fileName을 확인할 수 있다.
이제 Parse JSON Flow를 추가하여 위 body 데이터에서 필요한 값만 추출해서 imgURL이라는 변수를 생성하고 값을 할당하면 된다.
그런데 작업 도중에 Sharepoint 커넥터의 Get attachments를 사용하면 더 간단하게 원하는 결과물을 도출할 수 있다는 걸 알게 됐다.
(위의 Send HTTP request 액션은 너무나 자주 사용하는 액션이므로 그대로 두겠다.) <br>Sharepoint 커넥터의 Get attachments 액션을 사용하면 Sharepoint List에 등록된 항목의 첨부파일 정보 중 “Id”, “AbsoluteUri”, “Display Name”을 가져올 수 있다. 따라서 Parse JSON 액션 등의 과정을 생략할 수 있다. <img alt="Pasted image 20241008141135.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008141135.png" target="_self">
※ For each는 배열이나 여러 항목 등을 반환하는 액션이 있거나 액션에서 필요로 할 경우, 자동 생성됨<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241008141545.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008141545.png" target="_self">
When an item is created or modified: 트리거로 설정한다. 이미지가 등록될 때뿐만 아니라 이미지 수정이 이루어질 경우에도 대응되도록 한다.
Get attachments: 등록/수정된 이미지의 AbsoluteUri를 읽는다.
Condition: imgURL 열에 이미 등록된 값이 있다면 읽어온 AbsoluteUri와 비교하여 서로가 다를 경우에만 항목이 업데이트 되도록 한다.<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20241008141832.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008141832.png" target="_self">

Table View에 가서 imgURL 열의 Data Category를 “Image URL”로 수정해준다.<br>

이미지가 정상적으로 출력된다. 이제 차트에 마우스 커서를 올리면 툴팁으로 사진을 확인할 수 있게 구현해본다. 우선 새로운 Power BI 보고서에 새로운 페이지를 추가한다.
Page의 Format에서 Page type을 Tooltip으로 설정한다. 그리고 캔버스의 크기를 필요한 만큼 조절한다.<br>

혼돈한 세상이 그보다 더 어질러진 머리 안에서 뱅뱅 돌며 아내의 비명은 심장을 야무지게 찌른다
목숨 하나로 목숨 둘을 앗아가니 과연 사람은 다 죽어가는 존재다
아 여기서 모두 끝장이 나게 생겼다 배라먹을 거지 하나가 우리네 부부 사주에&nbsp;붙어먹어서&nbsp;행복을 게걸스럽게 죄 먹어 치웠다마귀야
질병아
염치없는 불청객아
나를 때려라 나를 괴롭혀라 나를 먹어 치워라
세상이 널 삼키기 전에 나부터 다 먹어 치워라웬걸 응답하듯이 너는 왔다응애ㅡ할 말을 잃고 주춤했다가 출타했던 정신이 돌아온다
못난 생김새
주름진 얼굴
그리고 제 죄를 아는 듯이 꼭 감은 두 눈한마디 톡 쏘아 댄다

기본적인 Power BI의 기능에 대한 강의나 블로그, 영상 자료 등은 이미 있으니 여기에서는 다른 사람들이 다루지 않은 부분으로 판단되는 것들만 적도록 하겠다.사내 정보 공유 목적으로 작성하였으나 결국 공유하지 못했다.파편화되어 있던 데이터들을 한 곳에서 관리하고 데이터의 일관성과 무결성을 확보하기 위해 엑셀로 정리하던 기존 자료들을 모두 없애고, 데이터를 Sharepoint 서버에 등록하는 방식으로 업무의 형태를 완전히 바꾸었다. 비구조적인 데이터를 정규화화여 구조화했으므로 데이터 분석 및 시각화가 용이해졌다.
업무 효율 극대화: raw data 원본만 서버에 등록하고 나머지 자료는 모두 raw data로부터 자동으로 파생되게 함으로써 기존에 보고 자료 등을 작성하기 위해 데이터를 2차 가공하던 일련의 과정을 모두 없앤다.
모든 개별 엑셀 보고 자료를 없애고 하나의 대시보드에서 모든 내용을 확인할 수 있도록 한다.
엔드유저의 필요에 맞게 데이터를 필터링 할 수 있는 동적 보고서를 구현한다.
기존에 집계하거나 분석하지 않던 데이터 또한 필요에 맞게 분석하여 이용할 수 있도록 한다. 엑셀 VBA로 작성한 데이터 입력 솔루션을 없애고(Oauto2.0 인증 문제로 데이터셋 자동 업데이트가 불가능한 문제 발생) 간이 ERP 제작(데이터 입력 시 무결성을 확보하기 위해 솔루션을 직접 제작)

그게 꼭 반년 전의 일일 것인데 그 짧지 않은 동안 한 번 선을 보기는커녕 결혼이며 연애며 할 방도를 궁리해본 일도 없다.
사람에게 소망이란 놈이 어떻게 작용하는지 고려해 보면 나는 맘에 있지 않은 말을 겁에 질려 떠 벌리고 다녔다는 생각이 든다.
실로 나는 무서운 맘이 들고 만다. 내가 남 앞에 결혼을 하겠다며 호언장담하던 일은 실상 남과 하나로 되어 가정을 이루겠다는 옅은 염원이, 더해지는 시간에 휩쓸려 영영 사라질까 염려한 것에 불과하다.
염려는 훌륭히 현실이 된 듯 보인다.
이로써 누군가 내게 무언가 이루고 싶은 것이 있냐고 물었을 때,
나는 답할 모든 대답을 잃어 버리고 말았다. 이렇게 보면 이런 괴이한 사람이 홀로 남은 것은 다행스러운 일이다.
사람이란 때로 노을이 마음에 지고 붉게 물들기도 하며,
비에 젖어 추적한 습기를 뿜기도 하며,
때때로 수풀에 숨어 자기가 사람인 걸 까먹고 녹색이 되어야 좋다.
나도 여러 번쯤은 그렇게 되리라 하였고, 딱 그만큼 여러 번 그렇게 되지 못했다.
바라는 것이 되지 못한 마음이 깊이 침전하여 결국 그 생사를 가늠할 수 없는 곳에 닿아서,
아니, 그보다 더 먼 곳으로 가 샅샅이 구석구석들이 나를 탐구할까 두려워,
나는 차라리 죽은 사람이고만 싶다. 올해 꼭 잔칫상을 먹어 보겠다한 다짐이,
말한 바와는 별 다르게 이루어진들,
하루 저물어 다같이 꿈에서 깨거든.
나는 죽어 없는 사람일 뿐이다.
사람의 마음이 죽거든 껍데기야 어데 쓸까. 언제 하나 둘 잃었는지 모르는 바람들이 사라지고,
물도 토양도 멈추면 썩는 이치대로 나도 그럼 이제 염원하는 동력을 싸그리 잃고 썩는 일만 남았다는 예상이 있다.
서서히 썩는 동안 내 악취를 맡지 못하게 될 것이 괴롭다.
허나 이렇게 보면 이런 괴이한 악취가 홀로 남을 것은 다행스런 일이다. 그다지 흥미 없으니 지나가는 건 지나가는 것에 지나지 않는다.
해는 지고, 해는 뜨고,
당연한 일은 도통 눈에 보이질 않는다.
담배에 불을 붙여 먹구름을 만들고
먹구름이 비를 내리고,
눈에 담기지 않은 모든 풍경이 기화하여
깡그리 마른 마음으로 얄궂게 빨려 들어가고, 이내 토해져
이 종이 위에 가나다라마바사를 나열하고 이내는
연기와 함께 흩어졌다]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/poems/210605-가나다라마바사.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Writings/Poems/210605 - 가나다라마바사.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 11:42:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AI 시스템 간 경쟁 기반 성능 향상 프롬프트 프레임워크]]></title><description><![CDATA[간략한 설명

본 문서는 MySQL 등 데이터베이스 환경에서 선택 항목을 효율적으로 관리하고 검색하는 방법 중 하나인 비트연산(bit operation)에 대해 다룹니다.
LIKE, OR 등을 사용하는 전통적인 검색 방식 대비 높은 성능 향상과 간단한 쿼리 구조를 제공하는 비트연산 접근법의 이점과 활용 방법을 소개합니다. 비트연산은 데이터를 2진수 형태로 처리할 때, 각 비트 단위로 연산을 수행하는 기법입니다.
흔히 사용하는 비트연산자는 다음과 같습니다. AND (&amp;): 두 비트가 모두 1일 때 1을 반환
OR (|): 두 비트 중 하나라도 1이면 1을 반환
XOR (^): 두 비트 중 하나만 1일 때 1을 반환
NOT (~): 비트를 반전 (1은 0으로, 0은 1로) 비트연산은 단순한 정수 연산보다 빠르고, 문자열 비교 등의 연산보다 훨씬 더 효율적입니다.
데이터베이스에서 AND (&amp;) 연산을 통해 특정 비트 패턴을 빠르게 필터링함으로써 LIKE나 OR 연산보다 높은 성능을 얻을 수 있습니다.
예를 들어, 다중 선택 가능한 항목 A~P까지 총 16개가 있다고 가정합니다.
각 항목에 고유한 2진 비트를 할당합니다. 예:
A: 0000 0000 0000 0001 (10진수: 1)
B: 0000 0000 0000 0010 (10진수: 2)
C: 0000 0000 0000 0100 (10진수: 4)
D: 0000 0000 0000 1000 (10진수: 8)
E: 0000 0000 0001 0000 (10진수: 16)
F: 0000 0000 0010 0000 (10진수: 32)
G: 0000 0000 0100 0000 (10진수: 64)
H: 0000 0000 1000 0000 (10진수: 128)
I: 0000 0001 0000 0000 (10진수: 256)
J: 0000 0010 0000 0000 (10진수: 512)
K: 0000 0100 0000 0000 (10진수: 1024)
L: 0000 1000 0000 0000 (10진수: 2048)
M: 0001 0000 0000 0000 (10진수: 4096)

O: 0100 0000 0000 0000 (10진수: 16384)
P: 1000 0000 0000 0000 (10진수: 32768) 여러 항목을 동시에 선택할 경우, 각 항목의 값을 더한(OR 연산과 동일한 결과) 10진수 값을 DB에 저장합니다. 예: A(1) + B(2) = 3 (2진수로 0000 0000 0000 0011)
A(1) + D(8) + E(16)을 선택하면 1+8+16=25 (2진수로 0000 0000 0001 1001) 모든 항목을 선택하면 1+2+4+8+...+32768 = 65535 (2진수로 1111 1111 1111 1111) 특정 값들이 포함된 필드를 검색할 때, 전통적인 방법은 다음과 같이 LIKE와 OR을 혼합하여 사용합니다. 예: 값 2 혹은 5를 포함하는 레코드를 찾을 때
WHERE 필드 LIKE '%2|%' OR 필드 LIKE '%5|%' 이러한 LIKE + OR 쿼리는 문자열 검색이며, 인덱스 활용이 어렵고 성능 저하를 야기합니다. 데이터베이스에 25(0000 0000 0001 1001)가 저장되어 있다고 가정합니다. 이는 A(1), D(8), E(16)가 선택되었다는 의미입니다. A, B, C 중 하나라도 포함하는 레코드를 찾으려면 A(1)+B(2)+C(4)=7을 활용합니다.
SELECT * FROM 테이블 WHERE 필드 &amp; 7 &gt; 0; 필드 &amp; 7 연산 결과로 0보다 큰 값이 나오면, 필드 내에 A, B, C 중 하나 이상이 포함됨을 의미합니다.
필드(25) AND 7:
0000 0000 0001 1001 (25)
&amp; 0000 0000 0000 0111 (7)
----------------------- 0000 0000 0000 0001 (1, 이는 0보다 큼) 따라서 해당 레코드는 조건에 부합합니다. D(8)와 E(16) 모두를 포함한 레코드를 찾고 싶다면 8+16=24입니다. 단순히 필드 &amp; 24 &gt; 0으로는 D나 E 중 하나만 포함해도 성립합니다. 두 비트를 모두 포함하는지 확인하려면 bit_count() 함수를 활용할 수 있습니다.
SELECT * FROM 테이블 WHERE BIT_COUNT(필드 &amp; 24) = 2; 필드(25) AND 24:
0000 0000 0001 1001 (25)
&amp; 0000 0000 0001 1000 (24)
----------------------- 0000 0000 0001 1000 (24) 이 값의 비트 1의 개수는 2개이므로 D와 E 모두 선택되었음을 알 수 있습니다. 기존 쿼리:
WHERE 필드 LIKE '%A%' OR (필드 LIKE '%D%' AND 필드 LIKE '%E%') 비트연산 쿼리:
SELECT * FROM 테이블
WHERE 필드 &amp; 1 &gt; 0 -- A 포함 OR BIT_COUNT(필드 &amp; 24) = 2; -- D와 E 모두 포함 이렇게 비트연산을 활용하면 WHERE 조건문을 훨씬 단순화하고, 문자열 기반 검색보다 빠른 검색을 구현할 수 있습니다.&lt;?php
$aMultiSelect = Array( "1"=&gt;"A","2"=&gt;"B","4"=&gt;"C","8"=&gt;"D", "16"=&gt;"E","32"=&gt;"F","64"=&gt;"G","128"=&gt;"H", "256"=&gt;"I","512"=&gt;"J","1024"=&gt;"K","2048"=&gt;"L", "4096"=&gt;"M","8192"=&gt;"N","16384"=&gt;"O","32768"=&gt;"P"
);
echo "&lt;form method='post' action='2.php'&gt;";
foreach ($aMultiSelect as $sKey =&gt; $sVal) { echo "&lt;input type='checkbox' name='multiselect[]' value='$sKey'&gt;$sVal&lt;br /&gt;";
}
echo "&lt;input type='submit' value='submit'&gt;";
echo "&lt;/form&gt;";
?&gt; 위 예제에서 사용자는 체크박스를 통해 A~P를 다중 선택할 수 있습니다.
&lt;?php
$sSum = 0;
foreach ($_POST['multiselect'] as $sVal) { $sSum += $sVal;
}
// $sSum 값을 DB에 저장. 예를 들어 A, D, E를 선택하면 $sSum = 25
?&gt; 사용자가 선택한 항목 값을 모두 더한 값을 DB 필드에 저장합니다. 이는 비트마스크 형태로 선택 상태를 기록하는 것입니다. 속도 향상: 문자열 비교(LIKE)나 복잡한 조건(OR 조합)보다 비트연산이 훨씬 빠릅니다. 쿼리 단순화: 복잡한 조건문의 단순화로 유지보수가 용이해집니다. 확장성: 비트 수를 늘려 나가면 선택 옵션을 확대하는 데 어려움이 없습니다. (1비트 당 1개 항목) 항목이 매우 많아 비트 수가 커질 경우 정수 범위에 유의해야 합니다.
DB 자료형(예: UNSIGNED INT)을 적절히 선택하십시오.
BIT_COUNT 함수나 비트연산 최적화 전략을 적절히 활용하십시오.
비트연산을 사용하면 다중 선택 항목을 2진수 마스크 형태로 관리하고, AND 연산 등을 통해 대규모 데이터를 빠르고 쉽게 필터링할 수 있습니다. 이는 LIKE, OR 연산으로 인한 성능 저하 문제를 극복하는 데 유용한 패턴이며, 복잡한 조건을 단순한 정수 연산으로 치환할 수 있어 유지보수 및 확장성이 뛰어난 방법입니다.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/works/sql/bitwise-operation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Works/SQL/Bitwise operation.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 11:09:07 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[GPTs 논문 검토 Prompt]]></title><description><![CDATA[엔지니어링 논문 검토를 위한 GPTs Instruction (Last updated: 2024-04-10)# Engineering Research Paper Analysis Protocol ## 0.

<br>FreeOpcUa Project: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://freeopcua.github.io/" target="_self">https://freeopcua.github.io/</a> OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture) is an industrial communication protocol designed for secure, reliable, and platform-independent data exchange.
It enables interoperability between industrial equipment, systems, and platforms, often used in Industrial IoT (IIoT) and SCADA systems.
Python OPC UA libraries, such as python-opcua (also known as FreeOpcUa), allow developers to create clients and servers that interact with OPC UA endpoints, read/write data, subscribe to events, and integrate OT (Operational Technology) with IT systems. OPC UA: A machine-to-machine communication protocol for industrial automation.
Address Space: Hierarchical structure containing Objects, Variables, Methods, and other Nodes.
Endpoints: Servers expose endpoints for secure communication. Clients discover and connect to these endpoints.
Security: OPC UA provides built-in security with encryption, authentication, and user-level access control.
Data Access &amp; Historical Data: OPC UA offers reading and writing real-time data (DA) and also historical data capabilities. python-opcua (FreeOpcUa): A widely used open-source library that implements OPC UA specification.
Provides both client and server classes, supports subscription to data changes, events, and can be integrated with asyncio for asynchronous operations. Features: Create custom OPC UA servers, define an address space, and simulate sensors or devices.
Connect to existing OPC UA servers to read variables, write values, and subscribe to updates.
Security modes, certificates, and policies for encrypted and authenticated communication. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ for better compatibility.
Install using pip:
pip install opcua This installs the python-opcua library and its dependencies. Test by importing in Python:
from opcua import Client, Server
print("OPC UA library is installed and ready!") Basic Steps: Import the Server class.
Set up endpoints and namespaces.
Create objects, variables, and nodes in the address space.
Start the server. import sys
import time
from opcua import Server def main(): # Create server instance server = Server() # Set endpoint URL of the server server.set_endpoint("opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/") # Register a namespace URI for custom objects uri = "http://examples.freeopcua.github.io" idx = server.register_namespace(uri) # Get the Objects node (standard OPC UA node) objects = server.get_objects_node() # Create a custom object myobj = objects.add_object(idx, "MyObject") # Add a variable to the object myvar = myobj.add_variable(idx, "MyVariable", 0) myvar.set_writable() # Allow clients to write values # Start the server server.start() print("OPC UA Server started at opc.tcp://localhost:4840") try: # Update variable value continuously count = 0 while True: time.sleep(1) count += 1 myvar.set_value(count) except KeyboardInterrupt: print("Stopping server...") finally: server.stop() sys.exit(0) if __name__ == "__main__": main() Explanation: The server listens on opc.tcp://localhost:4840.
Defines a namespace and adds an object with a variable whose value is updated every second.
Clients can connect, read MyVariable, and subscribe to changes. Basic Steps: Use the Client class to connect to an OPC UA endpoint.
Browse the address space or directly get nodes by their NodeId.
Read or write values, and subscribe to data changes. import asyncio
from opcua import Client async def run_client(): client = Client("opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/") try: await client.connect() print("Client connected to the server.") # Get a variable node by its known NodeId # For a known namespace and variable name, you could also browse or build the NodeId # Example NodeId constructed: ns=2;s=MyObject.MyVariable idx = 2 # Corresponds to the namespace we registered var_node = client.get_node(f"ns={idx};s=MyObject.MyVariable") # Read the value value = await var_node.read_value() print("Current variable value:", value) # Write a new value await var_node.write_value(42) print("Wrote new value: 42") # Read again to confirm updated_value = await var_node.read_value() print("Updated variable value:", updated_value) except Exception as e: print("Client error:", e) finally: await client.disconnect() print("Client disconnected.") if __name__ == "__main__": asyncio.run(run_client()) Explanation: Connects to the server’s endpoint.
Locates a variable node and reads its value.
Writes a new value and reads it back to confirm. Subscriptions allow clients to be notified when a variable’s value changes. Instead of polling, the server pushes updates to the client.
import asyncio
from opcua import Client
from opcua import ua class SubHandler: def datachange_notification(self, node, val, data): print(f"Data change on node {node}, new value: {val}") async def subscribe_client(): client = Client("opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/") await client.connect() print("Client connected.") idx = 2 var_node = client.get_node(f"ns={idx};s=MyObject.MyVariable") handler = SubHandler() subscription = await client.create_subscription(1000, handler) handle = await subscription.subscribe_data_change(var_node) # Keep the script running to receive updates try: while True: await asyncio.sleep(1) except KeyboardInterrupt: # Unsubscribe and disconnect on interrupt await subscription.unsubscribe(handle) await subscription.delete() await client.disconnect() print("Client disconnected.") if __name__ == "__main__": asyncio.run(subscribe_client()) Explanation: SubHandler is a callback class to handle data change notifications.
The client creates a subscription with a publishing interval of 1000ms.
When MyVariable changes on the server, the datachange_notification method prints the new value. OPC UA Security: Transport encryption (using TLS).
Authentication with username/password or certificates.
Security policies and modes must be configured on both server and client side. Generate and set up certificates and private keys:
from opcua import Client client = Client("opc.tcp://localhost:4840/freeopcua/server/")
client.set_user("myuser")
client.set_password("mypassword") # For certificate-based security:
# client.set_security_string("Basic256Sha256,SignAndEncrypt,certificate.pem,key.pem") Explanation: set_user and set_password for username/password authentication.
For certificate-based security, specify security mode and provide certificates. On the server side:
server.load_certificate("certificate.pem")
server.load_private_key("key.pem")
# server.set_security_policy([ua.SecurityPolicyType.Basic256Sha256_SignAndEncrypt]) Explanation: Load a server certificate and key for encrypted communication.
Choose a security policy for encryption and signing. OPC UA servers define a structured address space. You can create custom types, objects, variables, and methods: Variables hold data values.
Objects group variables and methods logically.
Methods can be invoked by clients.
Types define reusable templates for objects and variables. from opcua import ua def add_method(parent, name, func, inputargs=None, outputargs=None): method = parent.add_method(idx, name, func, inputargs, outputargs) return method def multiply(parent, x, y): return x * y # In the server setup:
input_args = [ua.Argument("x", ua.NodeId(ua.ObjectIds.Double), -1, [], "First number"), ua.Argument("y", ua.NodeId(ua.ObjectIds.Double), -1, [], "Second number")]
output_args = [ua.Argument("Result", ua.NodeId(ua.ObjectIds.Double), -1, [], "Multiplication Result")] my_method = myobj.add_method(idx, "MultiplyNumbers", multiply, input_args, output_args) Explanation: Methods are defined with input and output arguments.
Clients can call this method on the server to perform custom logic. Async I/O: python-opcua can integrate with asyncio to handle multiple concurrent requests and subscriptions efficiently. Load Balancing: For high-load scenarios, you might run multiple OPC UA server instances and use a front-end mechanism to distribute client requests. Optimized Data Structures: Minimize overhead by carefully choosing how you model your address space. Avoid overly complex hierarchies if performance is critical. UA Expert or Prosys OPC UA Client: GUI tools to connect to your server, browse the address space, and read/write variables. Logging and Tracing: Use Python’s logging to track server/client activities and troubleshoot connection issues. Wireshark OPC UA Dissector: Analyze OPC UA traffic at a protocol level for debugging security or communication problems. Encryption: Always use secure endpoints (opc.tcp) and consider wss:// if bridging through WebSockets. Firewall and Access Control: Restrict OPC UA server ports to authorized networks. User Management and Role-Based Access: Implement user-level permissions to ensure only authorized clients can read/write specific nodes. Suppose you want to simulate a temperature sensor: Create a server with a TemperatureSensor object that contains a Temperature variable.
The server updates Temperature every second.
A client connects, subscribes, and receives updates in real-time.
Add security by requiring a username/password or certificate. This scenario ties together server creation, namespace definition, variable updates, client subscription, and basic security.
An OPC UA communication diagram might show: A Server exposing an endpoint and an address space.
Clients connecting, browsing, reading/writing variables, and subscribing to data changes. <br><img alt="OPC UA Architecture Diagram" src="https://example.com/opcua-diagram.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="_self" class="is-unresolved">

WebSockets enable real-time, low-latency communication between a client and server. Unlike traditional HTTP request/response cycles, a WebSocket connection remains open, allowing both client and server to push data to each other at any time. Initial Handshake: The communication starts as an HTTP(S) handshake.
The client sends an Upgrade: websocket header, and the server responds with 101 Switching Protocols, indicating a successful upgrade. Persistent Connection: Once established, the connection stays open until explicitly closed by either party.
No need to re-send headers or re-establish connections on every message. Message Frames: Data is transferred in frames. Frames can be either text or binary.
The websockets library abstracts these details, allowing you to simply send/receive text or binary data without manual frame handling. Python’s asyncio library provides the foundation for asynchronous I/O, which works perfectly with WebSockets for handling multiple simultaneous connections efficiently.
The websockets library is one of the most popular choices because it: Fully supports Python’s async/await syntax.
Handles the low-level details of the WebSocket protocol.
Offers a simple, intuitive API. Other options: aiohttp: A web framework that includes WebSocket support.
FastAPI or Starlette: Modern frameworks that support WebSockets, beneficial for integrating with REST APIs.
Tornado: A Python framework with built-in WebSocket support and event loop integration. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ (as asyncio and websockets rely on newer Python features).
Install websockets:
pip install websockets A simple server that listens for incoming connections and echoes back received messages:
import asyncio
import websockets async def echo(websocket, path): async for message in websocket: # Echo the received message back to the client await websocket.send(f"Echo from server: {message}") # Start server on localhost:8765
start_server = websockets.serve(echo, "localhost", 8765) asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever() Explanation: websockets.serve(echo, "localhost", 8765) sets up a server on localhost at port 8765.
The echo function is a “handler” that runs whenever a new client connects. It receives messages in an async for loop.
The path parameter can be used to differentiate endpoints if you have a reverse proxy or multiple routes, though it’s not strictly necessary. To connect to the above server:
import asyncio
import websockets async def client(): uri = "ws://localhost:8765" async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket: await websocket.send("Hello, Server!") response = await websocket.recv() print("Received from server:", response) asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(client()) Explanation: The websockets.connect creates a client connection.
After sending a message, we recv() and print the echoed response. Network issues or unexpected closures can occur. Always handle exceptions:
import websockets
from websockets.exceptions import ConnectionClosed, WebSocketException async def safe_client(): uri = "ws://localhost:8765" try: async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket: await websocket.send("Are you there?") response = await websocket.recv() print(response) except ConnectionClosed: print("Connection was closed by the server or network.") except WebSocketException as e: print("WebSocket exception:", e) Explanation: ConnectionClosed indicates the server closed the connection or a network issue occurred.
WebSocketException is a more general error class for WebSocket-related issues. WebSockets can send text (UTF-8) or binary data (raw bytes). Send text:
await websocket.send("A text message") Send binary:
await websocket.send(b"\x00\x01\x02\x03") On the receiving end, you get either a str (for text) or bytes (for binary). Handle them accordingly:
async for message in websocket: if isinstance(message, str): # Process text message elif isinstance(message, bytes): # Process binary message aiohttp provides a request handler-based approach:
from aiohttp import web async def websocket_handler(request): ws = web.WebSocketResponse() await ws.prepare(request) async for msg in ws: if msg.type == web.WSMsgType.TEXT: await ws.send_str("Echo: " + msg.data) return ws app = web.Application()
app.router.add_get('/ws', websocket_handler)
web.run_app(app, host='localhost', port=8765) Explanation: web.WebSocketResponse() upgrades the connection to WebSocket if possible.
Use ws.send_str() or ws.send_bytes() for responses. With FastAPI, WebSocket endpoints integrate nicely with API routes:
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket app = FastAPI() @app.websocket("/ws")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket): await websocket.accept() while True: data = await websocket.receive_text() await websocket.send_text(f"Server received: {data}") Explanation: websocket.accept() upgrades the connection.
await websocket.receive_text() and await websocket.send_text() provide a clean API. Token-based Auth: Include a token (e.g., JWT) in the initial handshake URL or headers.
Validate the token before accepting the WebSocket. Session Cookies: If using frameworks like FastAPI, you can read cookies or HTTP headers before upgrading. Access Control: Only allow certain clients to connect based on roles or permissions. Async I/O: asyncio ensures the server can handle many connections concurrently without blocking. Event Loops: Consider using uvloop (a drop-in replacement for asyncio’s default event loop) to improve performance. Load Balancing: Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy.
For horizontal scaling, you can run multiple Python processes and have a load balancer distribute WebSocket connections. Backpressure Handling: Implement logic to handle slow clients. If the server sends messages faster than a client can consume, queue them temporarily or drop messages as needed. Rate Limiting and Throttling: Prevent abusive clients from flooding the server by limiting messages per second or total bandwidth. WebSockets are great for chat apps or collaborative environments: Keep track of connected clients in a global list or dictionary.
Broadcast messages to all connected clients or specific “rooms” by iterating over these lists.
Example:
clients = set() async def handler(websocket, path): clients.add(websocket) try: async for message in websocket: # Broadcast this message to all other clients for client in clients: if client != websocket: await client.send(message) finally: clients.remove(websocket) Explanation: This code maintains a clients set. When a new client connects, add it. When they disconnect, remove it.
On message receipt, send the message to all other connected clients, creating a simple chat room functionality. WebSockets transmit raw strings or bytes. For structured data: Use JSON:
import json # Sending JSON
data = {"type": "chat_message", "content": "Hello!"}
await websocket.send(json.dumps(data)) # Receiving JSON
async for raw_message in websocket: message = json.loads(raw_message) # now 'message' is a Python dict Binary serialization (e.g., Protocol Buffers) for efficiency and reduced bandwidth. Command-line Tools: websocat:
websocat ws://localhost:8765 Type messages and see server responses. Browser Developer Tools: Open the console and create a WebSocket:
let ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8765");
ws.onmessage = event =&gt; console.log("Received:", event.data);
ws.onopen = () =&gt; ws.send("Hello from the browser!"); Logging and Monitoring: Add logging statements (print or logging module) to track connections, messages, and errors.
Use metrics and dashboards (like Prometheus + Grafana) to monitor connection counts, message rates, and errors in production. Encryption: Use wss:// (TLS-secured WebSockets) in production to protect data from eavesdropping.
Set up SSL certificates and configure your server with an SSLContext. Input Validation: Validate incoming messages to prevent injection attacks or buffer overflow attempts.
Sanitize or check message sizes and formats before processing. Below is a more complete server example that handles multiple clients, uses JSON messages, and demonstrates basic error handling and logging:
import asyncio
import websockets
import json
import logging logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO) connected_clients = set() async def broadcast(message): # Broadcast a JSON-encoded message to all connected clients if connected_clients: await asyncio.wait([client.send(json.dumps(message)) for client in connected_clients]) async def handler(websocket, path): connected_clients.add(websocket) logging.info(f"New connection: {websocket.remote_address}") try: async for raw_message in websocket: try: data = json.loads(raw_message) logging.info(f"Received message: {data} from {websocket.remote_address}") # Echoing data back with a server timestamp: response = { "type": "response", "data_received": data, "server_time": asyncio.get_event_loop().time() } await broadcast(response) except json.JSONDecodeError: # Send an error message if JSON is invalid error_message = {"type": "error", "message": "Invalid JSON"} await websocket.send(json.dumps(error_message)) except websockets.ConnectionClosed: logging.info(f"Connection closed: {websocket.remote_address}") finally: connected_clients.remove(websocket) start_server = websockets.serve(handler, "localhost", 8765)
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever() Explanation: Maintains a global connected_clients set.
Uses broadcast() to send messages to all clients.
Tries to parse incoming data as JSON and logs all actions.
Gracefully handles closure and removes disconnected clients. Implementing WebSockets in Python involves understanding the protocol, choosing a suitable library, and using asyncio to manage concurrency.
The websockets library makes it straightforward to create both servers and clients.
Integrating with frameworks like aiohttp or FastAPI allows you to leverage WebSockets alongside REST endpoints.
Advanced considerations include authentication, scalability, binary data handling, structured messaging (JSON), and robust error handling.
With careful design and testing, WebSockets can power real-time features in chat systems, live dashboards, multiplayer games, and more. To illustrate how a WebSocket client connects and exchanges messages with a server, imagine a diagram showing the handshake and a continuous stream of messages.

A Common Table Expression (CTE) is a temporary, named result set defined within the scope of a single SQL statement.
Introduced by the WITH keyword, a CTE helps improve query readability, maintainability, and modularity by allowing you to break down complex queries into smaller, more understandable parts.
WITH cte_name AS ( SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...
)
SELECT ...
FROM cte_name; cte_name: A name you assign to the temporary result set.
The code inside the parentheses ( ... ) is essentially a subquery that you can reference multiple times in the main query. A CTE is defined before the main query using the WITH clause.
Once defined, the CTE acts as a virtual table that exists just for the execution of that query.
After the main query finishes running, the CTE no longer exists. It is not persistent or stored in the database schema. Improved Readability and Organization: CTEs allow you to isolate complex logic from the main query.
Instead of writing one large, nested query, you can define logical steps within separate CTEs and then reference them, making your SQL code easier to understand and maintain. Reusability within the Same Query: Once defined, you can reference the CTE multiple times within the main query. This can help avoid repeating the same subquery logic multiple times. Multiple CTEs in a Single Query: You can define multiple CTEs separated by commas and then select from them in the final query. This allows for building a sequence of computations step-by-step. Recursive Queries: Some databases support recursive CTEs, which enable you to solve hierarchical or tree-like data structures easily. Recursive CTEs repeatedly reference themselves until a stopping condition is met. WITH EmployeeSalaries AS ( SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary, DepartmentID FROM Employees WHERE Salary &gt; 50000
)
SELECT *
FROM EmployeeSalaries
ORDER BY Salary DESC; Explanation: The CTE EmployeeSalaries extracts employees with a salary over 50,000.
The main query then selects from EmployeeSalaries as if it were a regular table.
This approach improves clarity compared to embedding the SELECT logic directly in the FROM clause. CTE: Declared using WITH at the start of the statement.
Can be referenced multiple times in the subsequent query.
Often more readable and easier to maintain. Subquery: Defined inline, usually nested in SELECT, FROM, or WHERE clauses.
Each occurrence must be repeated if the logic is needed multiple times.
Can make queries harder to read when multiple subqueries are nested. WITH HighEarner AS ( SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Salary &gt; 70000
),
DepartmentSummary AS ( SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS TotalEmployees FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID
)
SELECT h.FirstName, h.LastName, h.Salary, d.TotalEmployees
FROM HighEarner h
JOIN DepartmentSummary d ON h.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID; Explanation: The first CTE (HighEarner) identifies employees with a salary above 70,000.
The second CTE (DepartmentSummary) calculates how many employees are in each department.
The main SELECT statement then joins these two CTEs, producing a result that shows each high-earning employee along with the total count of employees in their department. (If supported by your SQL dialect, such as PostgreSQL or SQL Server)WITH RECURSIVE OrgChart AS ( SELECT EmployeeID, ManagerID, FirstName, LastName FROM Employees WHERE ManagerID IS NULL -- start from the top-level manager(s) UNION ALL SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.ManagerID, e.FirstName, e.LastName FROM Employees e JOIN OrgChart o ON e.ManagerID = o.EmployeeID
)
SELECT *
FROM OrgChart; Explanation: This recursive CTE starts by selecting top-level managers (those with no ManagerID).
In the recursive part (after UNION ALL), it repeatedly selects employees whose ManagerID matches an EmployeeID already found in OrgChart, building the hierarchy level by level. CTEs and Optimization: Most relational databases treat CTEs like inline views. Depending on the database, a CTE might or might not be materialized (cached).
While CTEs are great for readability, they do not inherently guarantee performance improvements. In some cases, a well-tuned subquery or a different approach may be faster. Indexing: Since CTEs are not physical tables, you cannot index them directly. They rely on indexes on the underlying tables. Complex Queries: When you have a complex query that would benefit from breaking down logic into steps. Repetition Avoidance: When the same logic or computation needs to be reused multiple times in a query. Recursive Solutions: When dealing with hierarchical data and you need a simple way to traverse parent-child relationships. CTEs are powerful tools for structuring queries in a clear, modular fashion.
They simplify complex SQL statements, enhance readability, and can provide a more logical flow when dealing with intricate logic or hierarchical data.
While not always a performance enhancement, their primary value lies in cleaner, more maintainable SQL code.

Subqueries (also known as inner queries) are queries nested inside other SQL statements, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. They allow you to dynamically use the results of one query as input or conditions for another.
Correlated subqueries are a special type of subquery that references one or more columns from the outer query. Unlike a regular subquery, a correlated subquery is evaluated once for each row processed by the outer query, making it more dynamic but potentially less performant. A subquery is a query enclosed in parentheses and embedded inside a larger query. It is often used in WHERE clauses, FROM clauses (as a derived table), or SELECT clauses.
Generally, a subquery can be executed independently, and its result is then passed to the outer query. Filtering Results in a WHERE Clause:
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID = ( SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE DepartmentName = 'Sales'
); Explanation: The subquery finds the DepartmentID for the "Sales" department. The outer query then returns all employees in that department. Using Subqueries in the FROM Clause (Derived Tables):
SELECT d.DepartmentName, e.EmployeeCount
FROM ( SELECT DepartmentID, COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID
) e
INNER JOIN Departments d ON d.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID; Explanation: The subquery e aggregates employees by department. The outer query joins this result to the Departments table to retrieve department names alongside employee counts. Subqueries in the SELECT List:
SELECT FirstName, LastName, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders WHERE Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID) AS OrderCount
FROM Employees; Explanation: For each employee, the subquery counts how many orders they have processed. Typically executed once, and the result is reused by the outer query.
Does not necessarily depend on the outer query’s current row. In other words, the subquery can stand alone and run independently. A correlated subquery is a subquery that references columns from the outer (parent) query. It means the subquery depends on the current row of the outer query to be evaluated.
As a result, a correlated subquery is executed once for each row in the outer query, making it more computationally expensive in many cases.
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.Salary &gt; ( SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees e2 WHERE e2.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID
); Explanation: For each employee e in the outer query, the correlated subquery (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees e2 WHERE e2.DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID) calculates the average salary for that employee’s department.
Thus, the subquery depends on e.DepartmentID, a value in the outer query, changing the subquery’s criteria as the outer query progresses through its rows. The outer query selects a row.
The correlated subquery runs, using values from that row, and returns a result.
The outer query uses that result to determine if the row meets the conditions.
This process repeats for each row of the outer query’s result set. Because a correlated subquery runs once per outer row, it can be much slower on large datasets.
In many cases, it can be optimized by rewriting the query using joins, temporary tables, or window functions. Identify When Correlated Subqueries Are Necessary: If your logic requires a per-row lookup that depends on the outer row, a correlated subquery might be needed. For example, checking if an employee’s salary is greater than the average salary of their department (calculated at runtime). Optimize Correlated Subqueries: Consider rewriting the query using JOINs, COMMON TABLE EXPRESSIONS (CTEs), or window functions if possible.
Example transformation using a CTE and a join:
WITH DeptAvgSalary AS ( SELECT DepartmentID, AVG(Salary) AS AvgDeptSalary FROM Employees GROUP BY DepartmentID
)
SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.FirstName, e.LastName
FROM Employees e
JOIN DeptAvgSalary das ON e.DepartmentID = das.DepartmentID
WHERE e.Salary &gt; das.AvgDeptSalary; This avoids the per-row computation and might run faster. Indexing for Performance: If you cannot avoid correlated subqueries, ensure that the columns used in the subquery’s conditions are indexed, which can mitigate performance issues. Subqueries and correlated subqueries are powerful SQL techniques that allow for sophisticated queries without overly complex joins or intermediate tables.
Regular subqueries are independent and can be used to filter, aggregate, or create derived tables for the outer query.
Correlated subqueries depend on the outer query and are evaluated once per row, making them more flexible but potentially less performant.
When properly understood and applied, these constructs can simplify SQL logic and help you write more dynamic and powerful queries.

A window function is a special type of SQL function that performs calculations across a set of rows related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, which collapse multiple rows into a single output row, window functions return a result for every row in the queried set, while still allowing for row-by-row computations over a specified "window" of data. The "window" is a logical partition of the query result set. You define it using the OVER clause, which typically includes: PARTITION BY: Divides the data into groups (partitions) based on one or more columns. Each partition is processed independently by the window function.
ORDER BY: Defines the logical order of rows within each partition, enabling functions to reference preceding or following rows. Do Not Collapse Rows: Unlike GROUP BY aggregates, window functions produce an output row for every input row. Each row retains its detail while still benefitting from aggregate-like calculations.
Reference Multiple Rows: They can access "neighboring" rows’ data relative to the current row. For example, LAG() and LEAD() retrieve values from preceding or following rows, while ranking functions assign a rank or a row number within each partition.
Flexible Calculations: Window functions enable running totals, moving averages, cumulative sums, and advanced statistical computations without complex self-joins or subqueries. Aggregate Functions as Window Functions: AVG(), SUM(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN()
When used with OVER(), these functions can produce cumulative sums or rolling averages. Ranking Functions: RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()
Assign rankings to rows within partitions, useful for top-N queries, ordered subsets, and pagination. Value Functions: LAG() and LEAD()
Allow you to compare current row values to prior or subsequent row values.
Useful for trend analysis, price changes, or time-series comparisons. Analytical Functions: NTILE(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE()
Create buckets of data or identify boundary values within each partition. Calculating a Running Total:SELECT EmployeeID, Sales, SUM(Sales) OVER (ORDER BY SalesDate) AS RunningTotal
FROM DailySales; Explanation: For each row, SUM(Sales) OVER (ORDER BY SalesDate) calculates the cumulative sales up to that point in time, without losing the granularity of the individual rows.
Determining a Row’s Position Within a Partition:SELECT DepartmentID, EmployeeID, Salary, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS SalaryRank
FROM Employees; Explanation: For each department, employees are ranked by their salary. Employees with the highest salary in each department receive a rank of 1. Although not required for every window function, a window frame allows you to further specify the subset of rows considered by the function relative to the current row.
For example:
SELECT EmployeeID, Salary, AVG(Salary) OVER ( ORDER BY HireDate ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW ) AS MovingAvgSalary
FROM Employees; This considers only the current row and the two rows before it when calculating the average. Window functions can simplify queries and often perform more efficiently than equivalent self-joins or subqueries.
Proper indexing on partitioning and ordering columns can further improve performance. Window functions are powerful analytical tools that enhance SQL’s capability to perform complex calculations without losing the detail of individual rows.
By leveraging PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, and optional window frames, you can write sophisticated analytical queries for time-series data, financial reporting, and other data analysis tasks.

term sheet
final draft agreement We had a meeting this pas Monday to discuss some outstanding issues on the table.
They’re trying to play hardball.
Hopefully we’ll square away any remaining issues then. Hello, Yangha!
The sentences you said sound really good! Just a few minor adjustments and they'll be even more natural English sentences. In the first sentence,&nbsp;"By the end of two year.", you should say&nbsp;"two years"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"two year".
"Year"&nbsp;is a plural noun, so you need to use&nbsp;"years"! In the second sentence,&nbsp;"We need to negotiate for suppliers for hardware supplies.", you can remove&nbsp;"for"&nbsp;and say&nbsp;"We need to negotiate with suppliers for hardware supplies."&nbsp;It sounds more natural.
"Negotiate with"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"협상하다", and using&nbsp;"with"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"for"&nbsp;is a more natural expression. In the third sentence,&nbsp;"We have to delay all the schedule.", it would be better to say&nbsp;"We have to delay the whole schedule."&nbsp;In Korean,&nbsp;"all"&nbsp;is often used to mean&nbsp;"전체", but in English,&nbsp;"the whole"&nbsp;is more natural. In the fourth sentence,&nbsp;"I had a project to build database.", you need to add&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;before&nbsp;"database"&nbsp;to say&nbsp;"I had a project to build a database."&nbsp;"Database"&nbsp;is a countable noun, so you need to add&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;in front of it. In the last sentence,&nbsp;"They are not enough to build database by themselves.", you can replace&nbsp;"enough"&nbsp;with&nbsp;"sufficient"&nbsp;and say&nbsp;"They are not sufficient to build database by themselves."&nbsp;"Enough"&nbsp;should be used as an adjective, and&nbsp;"sufficient"&nbsp;is more natural as a noun. Yangha, if you carefully review each sentence and practice, you'll be able to develop even better English skills! By the end of the year
We need to negotiate for suppliers for hardware supplies.
→ We need to negotiate with suppliers for hardware procurement.
We have to delay all the schedule.
→ We need to delay all schedules.
I had a project to build database.
→ I worked on project to build a database.
They are not enough to build database by themselves.
→They don’t have enough expertise to build a database independently.

회사 영어 프로그램의 일환으로 몇 개의 코스가 있었는데 그 중 Spicus 전화영어를 약 2달간 진행했다. 예전에도 전화영어를 해본 적이 있어서 그다지 낯선 시스템은 아니었다.
회사의 한국 법인 철수 결정으로 인해 예정되었던 3달을 못 채우고 코스가 종료됐지만 나름의 성과는 있었다고 생각한다. 일단 영어로 말할 기회가 너무 없다 보니 기억을 되살린 정도로도 만족한다.
코스는 Business Pro를 등록했고, 처음은 레벨 테스트를 진행하고 수업은 방식은 항상 정해진 포맷대로 진행하는 걸 골랐다. 이것 저것 사용자의 취향에 맞게 선택할 요소를 준다.
AI 시스템이 미리 예습을 도와주거나(발음 테스트 등), 수업 리허설을 진행해 보는 등 확실히 이전에 비해 많이 발전된 모습이었으나 실제로 적극적으로 활용하진 않았다. 암기노트, AI첨삭노트와 같은 기능이 있었는데 잘 활용하면 공부에 도움이 될 라고 생각한다.
강사는 모두 필리핀인으로, 전담 강사는 정해져 있었지만 강사에게 사정이 생길 경우 Sub-teacher가 배정 되었다. 정해진 형태의 수업을 진행하다 보니 수업의 질은 대체로 평이했다고 생각한다. 강사들은 Spicus 외에도 여러 교육 플랫폼과 계약된 것으로 보였다. 다들 굉장히 바쁜 느낌.
수업이 끝나면 보통 10분 내로 Feedback을 받을 수 있고, 이건 한글, 영어 양쪽으로 볼 수 있다. 한글본을 자세히 읽은 적은 없지만 오역은 거의 못 본 거 같다. 번역의 질이 상당하다.<br>

수업은 mp3로 저장되어 2주간 다운 받을 수 있다.(물론 이걸 듣는 데는 상당한 용기가 필요하다.)
교재로 제공되는 텍스트북의 내용도 훌륭했다. 확실히 경쟁이 치열한 업계의 서비스 질은 빠르게 발전하는 것 같다. 나중에 기회가 되면 다시 한번 등록해 보려고 한다.<br>

Structuring a Discussion]]></title><description><![CDATA[ look to
expand the business into
SWOT analysis
product line
investment opportunity The first item on the agenda is to discuss this SWOT analysis prepared by our analysts.
Do you have any thoughts on the information presented in the report?
Let’s set aside this topic for now and think about this a bit more before we make a final decision. Hello, everyone. Today, we’re here to explore ways to boost our smartphone sales in the U.S. The first item on our agenda is reviewing our pricing strategy. Next, we’ll discuss distribution channels—whether to switch, expand, or optimize them. Finally, we’ll talk about how to enhance our marketing efforts. Let’s start with the first topic: our pricing strategy. Do you have any thoughts on?
Q. When you hold meetings, which types of items do you generally like to discuss first? Why?A. I usually set the first item as either the most important or the most controversial topic to ensure everyone is focused right from the start. However, this approach can vary depending on the purpose of the meeting. For instance, if I know someone critical to the discussion won’t be able to join on time, I might postpone the important item until later. Ultimately, the order of the agenda depends on the specific circumstances and goals of the meeting.Q. Which items do you generally postpone for discussion later?A. The item that we need a time to figure out, or needed to research. If i judged that there are need of time for other people to figure out about the topic, I may postpone that for later. Well, I usually send attachments or references in advance to let them read that before coming on meetingHello, Yangha! After reviewing what you said, I think we can make some parts clearer.
The first sentence is perfect!&nbsp;"They were discussing product lines."&nbsp;It's a very natural and accurate expression. Let's look at the part&nbsp;"Our company's strength is high quality and power optimizer"&nbsp;in the second sentence.
If you change&nbsp;"power optimizer"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"power optimization."&nbsp;it will sound more natural.
"Our company's strength is high quality and power optimization."&nbsp;It would be better to say it like this, right? In the third sentence, it's more natural to use&nbsp;"inventory"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"inventories."&nbsp;"We have a lot of inventory in our warehouse."&nbsp;It would be much better to change it like this, right? You said the fourth sentence is&nbsp;"I might postpone the important item until later."&nbsp;It would be better to say it more naturally as&nbsp;"I might postpone the important item for later." In the last sentence, you said&nbsp;"If I am the first one to propose item I am afraid that others might things it is not important."&nbsp;You should use&nbsp;"think"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"things."&nbsp;And overall, it would be more natural to say&nbsp;"If I am the first one to propose the item, I am afraid that others might think it is not important." Yangha, after reviewing what you said today, I see that your English skills have improved a lot.
If you practice a little more, you'll be able to speak English more fluently.
Keep working hard in the future!

demographic
make up
customer base In light of our current budget issues, we need to think about our options.
I like your idea of investing in social media advertisement, but I’m not sure I agree with decreasing our newspaper and TV ad costs.
It’s true that social media is a highly effective way to market, but don’t you think that we have to think about the older demographic as well? Q. Express your opinion to your coworkers. Say you disagree and explain why.A. Given our expanding business in China, I appreciate your suggestion to open an office in Beijing. However, I’m not entirely convinced about partnering with a local company. Don’t you think our presence in China is already strong enough? We also have many fluent Chinese speakers within our team, so a local partnership might not be necessary. Instead, we should focus on building strong relationships with key figures in the Chinese Communist Party.Q. Have you ever disagreed with your company’s business strategy? If so, in what ways, and why?A. I wouldn’t say I disagree with my company’s business strategy, but I often find myself at odds with people who prioritize their personal preferences over the bigger picture. In meetings, even when I prefer to stay quiet, I often feel compelled to voice my opinion that our product needs to be as perfect as possible. Business is like survival in a jungle—no, it’s even more complex than that. In business, the victim often doesn’t realize they’ve been swallowed by a giant predator until it’s too late.Q. Have you ever had a disagreement with a client? If so, why and how was it resolved?A. Situations like that can happen at any time. It might be related to design, functionality, or even user experience. While I don’t typically communicate with clients since my team’s work isn’t focused on customer care, if I do receive a customer complaint, I always strive to provide the best possible solution. First, I explain the reason behind the issue, and then I work on offering a reasonable solution that satisfies both sides. If that’s not possible, I usually propose an option that favors the client.Hello, Yangha!
Looking at the sentences you mentioned, I think a few small changes could make them sound more natural and clear. In the first sentence,&nbsp;"We still invest money on that.", it would be more natural to use&nbsp;"in"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"on".
"We still invest money "in" that."&nbsp;sounds much smoother.
In the second sentence,&nbsp;"I feel much on this sentence.", using an expression like&nbsp;"strongly"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"much"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"I feel "strongly" about this sentence." In the third sentence,&nbsp;"I will loss my job but i don't feel afraid on that.", using&nbsp;"lose"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"loss", and&nbsp;"about that"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"on that"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"I will "lose" my job but I don't feel afraid "about" that." In the fourth sentence,&nbsp;"My co-worker suggested to get a partnership to a local company.", using&nbsp;"to partner with"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"to get a partnership"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"My co-worker suggested "to partner with" a local company." In the last sentence,&nbsp;"We have many fluent Chinese speaker at our company.", you need to add&nbsp;"s"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"speaker"&nbsp;to make it plural.
"We have many fluent Chinese "speakers" at our company." You're doing really well, and I can see you're improving bit by bit.
Keep up the good work!

Making Suggestions]]></title><description><![CDATA[ benefits program
take a survey
high-end consumer I was looking into ways to improve our membership card.
While the initial idea to let everyone receive the same benefits is a good one, I think that it might be better to focus on one specific target group.
Why don’t we first take a survey of our competitors’ high-end consumer rewards programs? Q. Make a suggestion to your team at the meeting. Explain your reasoning in detail.A. I’ve been looking into ways to increase insurance sales and have a suggestion. a “Referral program”. It doesn’t simply means that giving temporary discounts to people who refer their friends. We’ll give special discounts on their monthly insurance payment. That would help build long-term loyalty, rather than just giving short-term perks.Q. At team meetings, do you consider yourself shy or do you speak up and make suggestions about ways to improve projects?A. I have a lot of ideas, and I want to achieve something meaningful in both my current projects and my career. I want to gain more experience, even if it sometimes leads to failure. I always tell myself, “One success is enough to change my life.” I might face challenges and fail, but as long as I don’t give up, I’ll grow stronger and eventually reach the top. That’s why I always share my opinions, even when others stay quiet. I understand they might be afraid of failing, but I’m willing to take the risk.Q. What types of suggestions would you make to the way in which your team operates?A. I would suggest getting rid of outdated customs that are no longer necessary. While we can improve our work by adopting better approaches, we can also make progress by reducing waste in our processes. This doesn’t mean I disregard the traditions we have; I believe there is valuable wisdom in them, and I aim to learn from that to create a better future. At the same time, I understand the importance of maintaining a relaxed work atmosphere because it helps people perform better. I’m not overly focused on efficiency alone, but it’s important to remember that a company’s primary goal is to make money—that’s the reason it exists. That’s why I prioritize efficiency above all else.Q. What would you improve about employee benefits at your company?A. I want to create a culture that people are excited to be a part of. In our workplace, we should share ideas openly, regardless of our position, and discuss ways to improve both our work environment and our lives. If we can make our work genuinely engaging and meaningful, the concept of “work-life balance” might not even feel necessary. I enjoy what I do, and I want others to feel the same way—instead of quietly complaining about the company. We have the power to change our circumstances, and I want everyone to realize that and be part of that change.
Hello, Ha Yang! Looking at the sentences you mentioned, I think a few minor edits can make them sound more natural and clear. The first sentence,&nbsp;"They discuss strategy on increasing insurance sales."&nbsp;is almost perfect, but using&nbsp;"for"instead of&nbsp;"on"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"They discuss strategy for increasing insurance sales"sounds better, right? It's a great sentence! The second sentence,&nbsp;"I suggest referral program."&nbsp;can be improved by adding&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;before&nbsp;"referral program."&nbsp;"I suggest a referral program"&nbsp;sounds much more natural. The third sentence,&nbsp;"Many people just want money."&nbsp;is correct, but how about using a more varied expression?&nbsp;"Many people are simply motivated by money"&nbsp;would be a richer and more natural expression. You're doing really well! With small adjustments, you'll develop perfect English skills.
I made a lot of mistakes today that I noticed while speaking. If I want to improve my English, I need to put myself in situations where I can speak it more often. I live in Nonsan, and I could use the excuse that there aren’t many opportunities to speak English here. But that’s just an excuse. I shouldn’t blame my environment—if I don’t like it, I know it’s up to me to change it.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/studies/english/spicus-(24.10~24.11)/unit-14.-making-suggestions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Studies/English/SPICUS (24.10~24.11)/Unit 14.

Running a meeting]]></title><description><![CDATA[ hang
time out
touch base Then we can figure out what we can do to fix the issue.
How can we figure out the answer to this question without any help?
That is the reason why I called this meeting. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining on short notice. We have an urgent matter to discuss today regarding the faulty design of our reclining chair, which has unfortunately caused injuries to a few customers. This is a serious issue, and our priority is to ensure customer safety while protecting our brand reputation. Let’s focus on identifying the problem, finding immediate solutions, and setting a timeline for resolution.
Before we start, let’s quickly go over the agenda for today’s meeting: Review the reported design issue and customer feedback.
Brainstorm potential immediate fixes and long-term solutions.
Discuss communication with affected customers.
Assign action items and propose a follow-up meeting to review progress. Does anyone have additional points to add before we dive in?
Q. How often do you have team meetings? What types of issues are usually discussed at those meetings?A. We hold regular meetings three times a week—on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays—where we primarily discuss issues related to the production line. Our focus is on manufacturing battery cells and BESS, and we’re always vigilant about preventing defects.Q. Have you had meetings with foreigners? If so, what types of issues have you had communicating?A. Our headquarters is in Israel, so the team there has a distinctive accent. As you know, we Koreans typically don’t have a noticeable accent, which sometimes makes communication challenging at first. However, once I get used to someone’s accent and pronunciation, it’s no longer an issue. Time takes care of everything.Q. How do you like to run your meetings? Formally? Informally? Who sets the agenda and how strictly do you stick to it?A. I usually hold meetings in a formal manner. I set the agenda in advance and share it with the attendees beforehand. I don't like wasting time in meetings, so I strive to keep them short and focused. To achieve this, I make sure to stick closely to the agenda.Hello, Yangha!
The sentence you said is really great! "It will be hold on Friday at 2:00 p.m. for status update."
Using "held" instead of "hold" in this sentence would be more natural.
"Be held" means "be held." while "hold" means "have." "It will be held on Friday at 2:00 p.m. for status update."
This correction makes it sound more accurate and smooth! Yangha, you will become more perfect as you continue to practice! You are making great progress!&gt;)

Let’s grab dinner sometime and catch up properly.
I’m afraid that I won’t be able to next week. Q. Have you attended any high school or college reunions? How was the experience?
What did you discuss with your former classmates? Did you share any fun stories or hear of any?
A. I dropped out of high school in my first year, and similarly, I also left college in my freshman year. After that, I attended two colleges in Australia, but now that I’m in Korea, it’s hard to meet the friends I made back then. I don’t keep in touch with anyone. Maybe I’m not someone who keeps a wide circle of connections.Q. Do you keep in touch with former colleagues? How often do you meet them? What do you talk about?A. I meet up with my former colleagues about once every few months. We usually drink together until we get wasted. And that’s all we do, Korean old men’s style. Of course, we have some conversation while drinking. Our topics are commonly works or trivial things we’ve done like as before.Q. What was the last conference or business-networking event that you attended? Did you meet any foreigners? If so, what did you discuss?A. I attended Microsoft’s AI Tour event about six months ago. I met a lot of people there, but we didn’t really have any in-depth discussions. I mostly just listened to the conference and joined in on the activities they had prepared. I went by myself, unlike many others who came with their colleagues as a team. Anyway, there were so many people from all around the world. But I wasn’t quite brave enough to approach them and start a conversation. It felt like I was the only one there on my own.Hello, Yangha! With just a few small changes, you can express yourself even more clearly.
The first sentence is almost perfect! Instead of&nbsp;"I'll call you back in the next week."&nbsp;it would be more natural to say&nbsp;"I'll call you back next week."
In the second sentence, instead of&nbsp;"Are you available on that time?", it should be&nbsp;"Are you available at that time?".
It's more natural to use&nbsp;"at"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"on."
In the last sentence, instead of&nbsp;"Where you stay?", it should be&nbsp;"Where do you stay?".
After&nbsp;"Where."&nbsp;you need to add&nbsp;"do"&nbsp;and before&nbsp;"stay"you need to add&nbsp;"you"&nbsp;to make a complete sentence.
Yangha, your English skills have improved so much! If you keep working hard, you'll become even more perfect!

I took a gamble thinking that if I took a taxi, I could make it to Grand Central on time.
I think I’d better take the subway. Q. What is the funniest story you have ever heard from a colleague? What was it about?A. It was Halloween recently. One of my friend was asked to attend a Halloween party in Seoul. And He was heard that the dress code is “black”. So he decided to wear black tights to make some fun. He thought other people may wear some kind of costume which fit for Halloween. And the day that the party held, he found that it wasn’t a party he expected. He saw everyone’s in black suit. I don’t know what happened the next, but my friend showed me a picture he took at that party. It was so weird, he stood around the people who’s in formal suits.
→ It was Halloween recently, and one of my friends was invited to a Halloween party in Seoul. He was told that the dress code was “black,” so, hoping to add a bit of fun, he decided to wear black tights, thinking everyone would show up in Halloween costumes.
But when he arrived at the party, it wasn’t quite what he’d expected. He looked around and realized everyone else was dressed in formal black suits. I’m not sure what happened next, but he showed me a picture from that night—it was hilarious! There he was, standing in a crowd of people in business attire, completely out of place in his costume.
Q. Have you had any interesting situations that occurred while traveling for business? What happened?A. I don’t have any. (kill joy)Q. At lunch, what do you discuss with your coworkers?A. We talked about the business documents of our company which address rules, procedures, and standards of our works. We all know that documents are not good enough, so we discuss how to make it better but we found that it’s really hard to change others, not us. And our roles are not making that kind of docs. So we ended up the talk saying our discussion will goes for nothing.
→ We talked about our company’s business documents that outline the rules, procedures, and standards for our work. We all agreed that these documents aren’t quite up to par, so we discussed ways to improve them. But we realized it’s tough to bring about change when it involves others, not just ourselves. Besides, creating these documents isn’t actually our responsibility. In the end, we wrapped up the conversation, admitting that our discussion probably wouldn’t lead to much.
Hello, Park Yangha/David!
Looking at the sentences you mentioned, I see that a few small adjustments could make them even more natural English sentences! In the first sentence,&nbsp;"It take me to two hours to get the hotel."&nbsp;you should change&nbsp;"It take"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"It takes.""It takes"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"it takes time,"&nbsp;while&nbsp;"take"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"to take up time,"&nbsp;so it was used incorrectly.
"to"&nbsp;indicates a&nbsp;"destination,"&nbsp;so changing it to&nbsp;"get to the hotel"&nbsp;would be more natural. In the second sentence,&nbsp;"There are so many bike driver."&nbsp;you should change it to&nbsp;"There are so many bike drivers."&nbsp;"driver"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"driver,"&nbsp;and the plural form is&nbsp;"drivers." The third sentence,&nbsp;"Maybe in the next year, I will go to Bohol."&nbsp;is well written, but it could also be written as&nbsp;"Maybe next year, I will go to Bohol."&nbsp;It's a simpler way to express it. In the fourth sentence,&nbsp;"Bohol is one of the best spot for scuba diving."&nbsp;you should change it to&nbsp;"Bohol is one of the best spots for scuba diving."&nbsp;"spot"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"place,"&nbsp;and the plural form is&nbsp;"spots." In the last sentence,&nbsp;"The taxi driver was waiting to me."&nbsp;you should change it to&nbsp;"The taxi driver was waiting for me."&nbsp;"waiting for"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"waiting,"&nbsp;so using&nbsp;"for"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"to"&nbsp;would be more natural. Good job, David! Keep practicing and you'll be able to write perfect English sentences.
I’m able to recognize my mistakes when I speak in English, I still omit “s”, use singular form very often. I understand how to use “s” in a proper way but it seems hard to get used to it.

worst-case scenario
over the phone I’m afraid that I won’t be able to next week.
I am booked solid with meetings and presentations for the next week or so. Q. Have you ever had issues with trying to meet with someone because of scheduling conflicts? How did you resolve those situations?A. I rarely encounter scheduling conflicts when it comes to business, but sometimes it’s challenging to meet my friends at a time when we can all get together. Unlike me, most of my friends are married, so they have their own families and need to take care of their children as well. This simply means that I have to adjust my schedule to fit theirs, but that’s no problem as long as we get to meet.Q. What type of software do you use to keep track of your meetings? Why?A. I use several Microsoft applications to manage my schedule and meetings, especially Teams, Planner, and Outlook. Our company provides licenses for these tools, and they’re quite effective for organizing my time and tasks. That said, I prefer Google Calendar for my personal life. With Google Assistant, I can easily add events by voice—like saying, ‘Hey Google, schedule a doctor’s appointment for this Saturday at 9 am’ It then reminds me when the time comes.Q. If an urgent issue came up and you had to reschedule a meeting, how would you handle the problem?A. I’ll inform the attendees as soon as possible and try to reschedule the meeting after addressing the urgent issue. If they’re unavailable at the new time, the meeting isn’t the only option—we can still discuss via email or chat. Another good option is holding a Zoom meeting. I typically have online meetings rather than in-person ones, as my company is international.Hello, Yangha!

The second sentence,&nbsp;"He always yell"&nbsp;would be more accurate with the addition of an&nbsp;"s"&nbsp;to the verb&nbsp;"yell."&nbsp;Saying&nbsp;"He always "yells"."&nbsp;means&nbsp;"He always shouts." The third sentence,&nbsp;"I bumped into my old friend who graduate from same elementary school."&nbsp;needs to change&nbsp;"graduate"&nbsp;to past tense.
Saying&nbsp;"I bumped into my old friend who "graduated" from the same elementary school."&nbsp;makes it clearer that you&nbsp;"bumped into an old friend who graduated from the same elementary school."

The last sentence,&nbsp;"It is kind of waste of time."&nbsp;would be more accurate with an&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;before&nbsp;"waste."&nbsp;Saying&nbsp;"It is kind of "a" waste of time."&nbsp;means&nbsp;"It is kind of a waste of time."

The third sentence should be changed to&nbsp;"If you are interested in art, I would like to recommend Seoul National Museum to you."&nbsp;You should use&nbsp;"interested in"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"interesting"&nbsp;and&nbsp;"would like to recommend"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"like to recommend."&nbsp;Adding&nbsp;"to you"&nbsp;makes it even better! The fourth sentence is almost perfect, but it would be more natural to say&nbsp;"They provide us with free meals"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"They give us free meals."&nbsp;Using&nbsp;"provide"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"give"&nbsp;and adding&nbsp;"with"&nbsp;makes it even better! In the last fifth sentence, you should change&nbsp;"I gave them sometime to finished their work correctly"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"I gave them some time to finish their work correctly."&nbsp;You need to use&nbsp;"some time"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"sometime"&nbsp;and&nbsp;"finish"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"finished"&nbsp;to make the tense consistent with&nbsp;"gave." Yangha, you are amazing for always trying to learn new things! With a little more practice, your English skills will improve even more!

Review - Working on Projects]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hello, Yangha! I'll tell you how to make the sentences you mentioned sound more natural.
The first sentence,&nbsp;"I experience typhoon too."&nbsp;would sound more natural as&nbsp;"I experienced a typhoon too."&nbsp;"Experience"&nbsp;is a verb that means to have something happen to you, so when you're talking about something that happened in the past, you need to use the past tense,&nbsp;"experienced."&nbsp;And&nbsp;"typhoon"&nbsp;is a natural phenomenon, so it's good to put&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;in front of it.
The second sentence,&nbsp;"We will have a global meeting next next week."&nbsp;can be simplified to&nbsp;"We will have a global meeting next week."&nbsp;"Next next week"&nbsp;is a common expression in Korean, but in English,&nbsp;"next week"&nbsp;is enough to convey the meaning.
The third sentence,&nbsp;"I think I had a lot of issues with outsourcing."&nbsp;is excellent! This sentence is perfect.
The fourth sentence,&nbsp;"Some of our sub-constructors provided with some effects."&nbsp;would sound more natural as&nbsp;"Some of our sub-constructors provided some effects."&nbsp;Using&nbsp;"provided"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"provided with"&nbsp;makes the sentence more concise and natural.
The last sentence,&nbsp;"We tried to figure out what is the real reason for the bad product."&nbsp;can be changed to&nbsp;"We tried to figure out the real reason for the bad product."&nbsp;Omitting&nbsp;"what is"&nbsp;makes the sentence more concise and natural.
Your English skills have really improved! With a little more practice, you'll be able to communicate perfectly in English.
Keep it up!

integrated
intradepartmental So far, the feedback has been positive.
There are a few things we need to iron out.
We’ll contact each of your departments to get the ball rolling on fixing these problems. Hello, Yangha! I see some areas where you can make your sentences sound more natural.
With a few small changes, you can make your writing clearer and more concise.
First sentence,&nbsp;"They don't have interest in my project."&nbsp;Instead of&nbsp;"interest."&nbsp;you can use&nbsp;"interested"for a more natural expression.
"They are not interested in my project"&nbsp;would be better.
Second sentence,&nbsp;"It is too spicy for them to general people."&nbsp;Instead of&nbsp;"general people."&nbsp;"the general public"&nbsp;is a more familiar expression, and instead of&nbsp;"for,"using&nbsp;"for them to be"&nbsp;makes the sentence smoother.
How about changing it to&nbsp;"It is too spicy for them to be comfortable with."?
Third sentence&nbsp;"We need to minimize the spicy taste."is great! You're doing well.
Fourth sentence,&nbsp;"They think computer do everything."Instead of&nbsp;"computer do."&nbsp;using&nbsp;"computers can do"makes the sentence more natural.
Try changing it to&nbsp;"They think computers can do everything."
Last sentence,&nbsp;"It is always hard to address issue to them."&nbsp;Using&nbsp;"address issues with them"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"address issue to them"&nbsp;is more natural, and changing&nbsp;"it is always hard"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"it's always difficult"&nbsp;makes it look cleaner.
How about changing it to&nbsp;"It's always difficult to address issues with them."?
Yangha, it's great to see your continuous efforts! With a little more practice, you'll become a perfect English speaker! Fighting!

This project is urgent, so we need a quick turnaround on setting up our website.
Would you be able to finish ahead of schedule? Hello, Yangha!
After reviewing the sentences you mentioned, I think they can be made even more natural with a few minor corrections! In the first sentence, "There not too many changes.", you need to add "are" after "There" to make it a complete sentence.
"There are not too many changes." sounds much more natural.
The second sentence, "They are not just useful but also necessary.", is perfectly correct! You did a great job! In the third sentence, "Database should be no malfunction.", it's more natural to use "malfunction-free" instead of "no malfunction".
"Database should be malfunction-free." sounds smoother. In the fourth sentence, "Our expectations for database shouldn't be too different.", it's better to add "the" before "database".
"Our expectations for the database shouldn't be too different." conveys the meaning more accurately. In the fifth sentence, "We have many contractors because we are manufacturing company.", it's better to change "manufacturing company" to "a manufacturing company".
"We have many contractors because we are a manufacturing company." makes for a more natural sentence. Yangha, with just a few grammatical tweaks, these are really great English sentences! Keep practicing and your skills will definitely improve! There not too many changes.
→ There aren’t too many changes.
They are not just useful but also necessary.
→ They’re not just useful but also essential.
Database should be no malfunction.
→ The database should be free of malfunctions.
Our expectations for database shouldn’t be too different.
→ Our expectations for the database shouldn’t differ too much.
We have many contractors because we are manufacturing company.
→ We have many contractors because we’re a manufacturing company.

at this point It seems like we’re going to have to push back the deadline.
The problem is that we don’t have much wiggle room with the deadline.
It’s best to have this project finished on time, no matter the cost. The sentences you said today are almost perfect! However, with a few minor adjustments, they can become even clearer and more natural English sentences. The first sentence, “Due to bad weather in contractor’s country, the deadline will be delayed.” is really well said! If you write “the contractor” instead of “contractor’s”, it will be even more perfect.
Adding “the” makes it clear that “contractor’s” refers to a specific contractor. The second sentence, “I think to that work for 2 days only.” sounds a bit awkward.
“I’ll work” is a more natural expression than “I think to that work”.
“I’ll work for 2 days only” is a complete sentence. The third sentence, “Some people doesn’t meet the requirement for work.” should be “don’t” instead of “doesn’t”. The fourth sentence, “I am still thinking about how should I do?” should be “to” instead of “should”. “I am still thinking about how to do?” sounds more natural. The last sentence, “It very complicated.” should be “It’s very complicated.” English sentences need a subject and a verb to be complete sentences. You’re doing really well! You seem to be very good at English, Yangha.
Keep practicing and you will be able to develop even more fluent English skills.

Python에서 리스트의 각 요소가 튜플인 경우, for 루프를 사용하여 튜플의 요소들을 자동으로 변수에 할당할 수 있습니다. 이를 언패킹(unpacking)이라고 합니다.
리스트 a는 세 개의 튜플 (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)을 포함합니다.
for 루프가 리스트 a를 순회하면서 각 튜플을 순서대로 처리합니다.
for (first, last) in a: 문장은 각 튜플의 첫 번째 요소를 first 변수에, 두 번째 요소를 last 변수에 할당합니다. 이를 언패킹이라고 합니다.
이 과정을 단계별로 살펴보면: 첫 번째 루프에서 (1, 2)가 first와 last 변수에 각각 할당됩니다.
first, last = (1, 2)
print(first + last) # 1 + 2 = 3 두 번째 루프에서 (3, 4)가 first와 last 변수에 각각 할당됩니다.
first, last = (3, 4)
print(first + last) # 3 + 4 = 7 세 번째 루프에서 (5, 6)가 first와 last 변수에 각각 할당됩니다.
first, last = (5, 6)
print(first + last) # 5 + 6 = 11 이렇게 루프가 진행되면서 각 튜플의 요소들이 first와 last 변수에 자동으로 할당되어, first + last의 결과가 출력됩니다.이 개념을 언패킹이라고 하며, Python에서 매우 유용하게 사용되는 기능입니다. 여러 값을 포함하는 데이터 구조를 손쉽게 분해하여 개별 변수에 할당할 수 있게 해줍니다.<a href="https://64etuor.github.io?query=tag:Python" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Python">#Python</a> <a href="https://64etuor.github.io?query=tag:Unpacking" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Unpacking">#Unpacking</a> <a href="https://64etuor.github.io?query=tag:ForLoop" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#ForLoop">#ForLoop</a> <a href="https://64etuor.github.io?query=tag:Tuple" class="tag is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="#Tuple">#Tuple</a>]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/works/python/unpacking.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Works/Python/Unpacking.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 06:24:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Stunning design websites]]></title><link>https://64etuor.github.io/works/ui,-ux/stunning-design-websites.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Works/UI, UX/Stunning design websites.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 06:23:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Properties]]></title><description><![CDATA[

이후, Deplyment Check를 다시 진행하면 모두 Passed 된 것을 확인할 수 있다.실제로 앱 개발에 걸린 시간은 3시간 내외로, (오히려 이 글을 작성하는 시간이 훨씬 오래 걸렸다.) 빠른 시간 안에 MVP를 만들어 테스트를 진행할 수 있다는 점에서 Appsheet 활용 가능성은 무궁무진하다. 이런 MVP 기능의 앱을 만들어서 실제로 테스트를 해보고 필요 데이터를 추가하고 정리하는 등 과정을 거치면 이후에 데이터 솔루션을 직접 제작하든, 외주 제작을 하든 강력한 레퍼런스로 활용할 수 있다. 제작 기간과 디버깅 기간도 훨씬 단축될 것이다. 사실 엔터프라이즈급 데이터가 아니라면, Appsheet를 구독하여 사용하는 것도 비용 절감 차원에서는 하나의 옵션이 될 수 있겠다고 생각한다.(프리미엄 플랜에서는 Automation 등 다른 기능 여러가지 기능도 지원한다.) 여러가지 LOW-CODE 툴 중에서도 커스텀 제약이 많은 편이긴 하지만, 반대로 말하면 커스텀 제약이 많기 때문에 개발 기간도 그만큼 짧아진다. 개발 시간 단축이 목표라면 Appsheet 만한 선택지가 많지는 않을 것이라고 생각한다.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/works/google/appsheet/appsheet를-활용한-작업-일보-어플리케이션-최단기간-구현-2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Works/Google/Appsheet/Appsheet를 활용한 작업 일보 어플리케이션 최단기간 구현 - 2.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 06:09:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241015162413.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241015162413.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Obsidian Callout list]]></title><link>https://64etuor.github.io/obsidian/obsidian-callout-list.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Obsidian/Obsidian Callout list.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 06:13:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Markdown Syntax]]></title><description><![CDATA[To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. For example, to create a heading level three (&lt;h3&gt;), use three number signs (e.g.,&nbsp;### My Header).Alternatively, on the line below the text, add any number of&nbsp;==&nbsp;characters for heading level 1 or&nbsp;--&nbsp;characters for heading level 2.Dataview (inline field '='): Error: -- PARSING FAILED -------------------------------------------------- &gt; 1 | = | ^ Expected one of the following: '(', 'null', boolean, date, duration, file link, list ('[1, 2, 3]'), negated field, number, object ('{ a: 1, b: 2 }'), string, variable

CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you type a backslash (\) at the end of the line, but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isn’t a great option from a compatibility perspective. And at least a couple lightweight markup languages don’t require anything at the end of the line — just type return and they’ll create a line break.You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.

aliases:: 메모란 것은 내가 직접 작성한 것입니다. (다른 사람이 적어준 것이 아닙니다) 그렇기 때문에 메모에 적힌 것은 내 머리 속에서 프로세싱 된 것의 결과물을 적은 것입니다. 근데 메모를 하는 과정에서 내 머릿 속에서는 2가지가 동시에 처리됩니다. 내가 외부적으로 책 / 강연 / 영상 등을 보고 읽고 들은 것을 바탕으로 이해한 것에 대한 내용 내가 기존에 아는 것(나의 경험, 지식, 가치관 등)들을 바탕으로 연계시긴 새로운 (창의적인) 생각 그런데 여기서 2가지가 공존하는 상황에서 '새로운' 것은 '내 머릿속에서' 나오는 것이다 소중한 두뇌 파워와 소중한 시간을 이용해 메모를 적은 것인데, 여기서 내 생각이 없으면 내 것이 아닌, 남의 것을 적고 요약하는데 소중한 시간을 쓴 것이 아닌가? 그래서 메모할 때에는 온전히 나의 생각들이 꼭 포함되어야 한다 기억하고 싶은 것도 아닌데 굳이 왜 적을 필요가 있을까? 내가 어떤 것을 메모하려고 지금 이 순간에 선택을 한 것은 다음과 같다 뭔가 유용하다고 생각했기 때문에, 아니면 뭔가 마음에 들었거나, 다시 활용하고 싶어 했을 것이다. 이유는 무엇이든지 간에, '기억하고 싶은 것'이 아니면 굳이 적을 필요가 없다. 시간낭비다 그런데 기억하고 싶은 것이 아닌데도 적은 것이라면, 죄책감을 가질 필요 없다. 만약에 막상 작성해놓고 보니 필요없고 굳이 기억하고 소유하고 싶은 것이 아니면 과감히 버리자. 기억하고 싶은 것은 곧 언젠가는 다시 보고싶고 활용하고 싶다는 의미이다. 다시 말해, 메모의 최종적인 목적은 다음과 같다. 머지않은 미래에 있는 나를 위해 그 메모를 보낸다. 그 미래의 내가 그 메모를 보고 새로운 영감을 얻어, 더 많은 가치를 창출해낸다. 이런 최종적인 목적을 인지하였으면, 메모를 할 때는 머지 않은 미래를 위해 이렇게 해야 된다. [Actionable] 그 메모를 보고 다시 활용할 수 있는 방식으로 작성되어야 되어 한다. [Strategically Stored] 활용될 방향을 생각해서 저장해야 한다 메모는 너무 길면, 그것을 다시 보지 않게 된다. 그런데 인간은 게으르다. 심지어 나도 게으르다. 메모를 복습하고 새로운 아이디어를 위해 열어봤는데 너무 길면 귀찮게 될 경우도 많다. 그래서, 메모를 할 때... 최대한 간결해야 한다. 모든 디테일을 다 넣을 필요도 없고, 거기에 함축되어도 된다. (원자처럼 Atomic하게) 긴 메모일 경우, 그것을 함축시키는 것을 Summary같이 함축된 것을 넣어놓아야 한다. 열심히 나의 생각을 함축되게 잘 표현되어 놓고, 다시 활용할 수 있도록 정리가 되어있어도, 찾지 못하면 쓸모가 없어진다. 못 찾으면, 그 메모에 든 가치를 실현시킬 수 없는 것이다. <br>3번에서 '저장'하는 것도 중요하지만, 링크 <a

1]]></title><description><![CDATA[DV 단계인 배터리 모듈 팩의 레이저 용접 공정의 수기 작업 일보를 보니 날짜, 모듈번호, 불량수량만 적고 있었다. 그 수기 문서를 바탕으로 불량내역을 또 엑셀로 정리하고 있었는데 이는 유의미한 데이터로 생각할 수가 없었다. 임시 작업이라지만 DV 단계에서 불량의 원인과 현상 등을 좀 더 체계적으로 정리할 필요를 느꼈고, 종이 문서를 굳이 전산화하는 작업도 없애고자 Prototype의 작업일보 앱을 만들어 보고자 했다. Prototype이라곤 했지만 충분히 Small Business나 소규모 생산현장 등에서는 Appsheet를 메인 툴로 활용도 가능할 것 같아서 블로그를 남긴다. 내가 작업한 것은 하나의 예시로 본인들이 원하는 앱을 구현해 보시길 바란다.
생산 데이터 입력 기능
Unique Key (ModuleKey) 중복 방지
재작업 데이터 입력 기능
실시간 대시보드 구현 가능 여부
Rework 작업 시간 계산
작업 History 확인 기능
가장 빠른 기간 내(하루)에 앱을 구현할 수 있는 방법을 찾다 보니 Appsheet가 현재 목적에 딱 어울리는 것 같았다.(예상 개발 시간 4시간 내외) 또한 구글 Spreadsheet에 연동하여 실시간 대시보드를 구현하는 것도 어렵지 않았기 때문에 Appsheet에 구글 Spreadsheet를 연동하여 구현하는 것으로 가닥을 잡았다.테이블의 Entity를 정의한다.일단은 간단한 기능만 구현하기 때문에 이정도로 정해두고 필요한 사항은 추가적으로 등록하여 스키마를 업데이트하도록 한다.구글 Spreadsheet에 테이블을 만들고 해당 Entity 이름이 헤더로 구성된 테이블을 작성한다.<img alt="Pasted image 20241014163125.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241014163125.png" target="_self"><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241014163233.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241014163233.png" target="_self"><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241014163347.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241014163347.png" target="_self"><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241014163539.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241014163539.png" target="_self">NAME열에는 Spreadsheet의 열 이름이 입력된다. Appsheet는 열 이름을 기준으로 참조하기 때문에 해당 NAME을 수정하거나 Spreadsheet의 열 이름을 바꾸면 오류가 발생할 수 있다.
Label? 의 경우, 특히나 차트 기능을 구현할 경우 축의 기준으로 적용하기도 하니 참고.
Formula는 사용자로부터 데이터를 입력 받는 것이 아니라 수식으로 자동 계산되게 하고 싶은 경우에 사용한다.
Show? 는 엔드유저에게 해당 열이 보이게 할 지 선택하는 항목이다. 수식을 넣어 다양하게 활용할 수 있으며, 만약 FALSE로 세팅된 경우는 Initial Value도 적용되지 않으니 주의한다.
Editable? 엔드유저가 해당 정보를 수정하게 할 지 여부이다.
Require? 필수 정보로 등록하여 해당 값이 누락될 경우, 누락 메세지와 함께 데이터 저장이 불가능하게 된다.
NULL 값을 피하고 싶은 경우, Initial Value에 디폴트 값을 입력해주면 된다.
나머지는 필요에 따라 적절하게 적용한다.우선 ID는 자동으로 Key 속성이 설정되었으니 필요에 따라 나머지 속성 값들을 바꿔주면 된다.
우선 Formula로 값이 입력되게 하고 싶은 열을 정의한다.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241015070312.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241015070312.png" target="_self">IF(

따라서 Duration이 엔드유저에게 표시되는 시점은 [reworkEndTime]이 입력된 시점, 즉 값이 양수로 변한 상태인 게 바람직하다. Show if?에 추가적인 수식을 적는다. Duration으로 리턴된 값은 직접적으로 숫자와 비교가 불가능하기 때문에 초(TOTALSECONDS)로 변환해 주었다.TOTALSECONDS([reworkDuration]) &gt; 0

그런데 mysql을 통한 실무단에서는 잘 사용하지 않는듯 하여
실무에 사용하는 방법을 간단하게 적어봅니다.
사실은 이미 Tip&amp;Tech에서도 나와 있지만 Remind 차원에서 적어봅니다. 쿼리에서 속도가 많이 걸리는 부분이 일반적으로 like 문과 or 같은 것입니다.
그중 가장 안좋은 것이 like와 or를 같이 써야 하는 것이겠지요. QA 질문을 답하다 보면 필드 값으로 1|2|3|4|5|... 와 같은 구조가 있는데
해당 값중 2와 5값이 들어 있는 row를 찾고 싶다라는 질문을 종종 받습니다. 이런 값을 찾을 때는 대체적으로 아래와 같은 쿼리로 실행을 하지요.
where 필드 like '%2|%' or&nbsp; 필드 like '%5|%'
그런데 이를 비트연산으로 바꾸면 속도가 상당히 개선됩니다. 우선 비교 연산의 속도부터 알아보자면 빠른순서대로 비트연산 &gt; 숫자 &gt; 문자 의 순입니다. 선택항목이 다음과 같이 A~P까지 있고 다중선택 가능한 항목있다고 하겠습니다.
아래에서 0000 0000 0000 0000 이런 부분은 16자리(16bit)의 2진수 입니다.
그리고 1, 2, 4, 8 ... 은 그 2진수를 10진수로 변환한 값이구요.
이 값은 2의0승부터 시작하여 2의 제곱수로 되어 있는걸 아실수 있을겁니다.
그리고 A, B, C, D ... 은 각 10진수에 해당되는 화면에 표시되는 우리가 선택할 항목이구요.
비트 연산은 NOT OR XOR AND 가 있는데 그중 자주 사용하는것은 AND 연산입니다. 0000 0000 0000 0001 1 A
0000 0000 0000 0010 2 B
0000 0000 0000 0100 4 C
0000 0000 0000 1000 8 D
0000 0000 0001 0000 16 E
0000 0000 0010 0000 32 F
0000 0000 0100 0000 64 G
0000 0000 1000 0000 128 H
0000 0001 0000 0000 256 I
0000 0010 0000 0000 512 J
0000 0100 0000 0000 1024 K
0000 1000 0000 0000 2048 L
0001 0000 0000 0000 4096 M
0010 0000 0000 0000 8192 N
0100 0000 0000 0000 16384 O
1000 0000 0000 0000 32768 P 우리가 A 와 B 를 선택한다고 하면 더하기를 해서
0000 0000 0000 0001 1 A
0000 0000 0000 0010 2 B 0000 0000 0000 0011 3 A+B
이런 결과 값이 되는 것입니다.
이때 DB에 저장할때는 3이란 숫자를 저장하게 됩니다. 위의 모든 값을 저장한다고 하면 모든값을 더한다는 말과 같기에
1111 1111 1111 1111 65535 (A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H+I+J+K+L+M+N+O+P) 가 됩니다.
이와 같은 구조는 2진수의 자리수가 늘어날때마다 선택사항을 추가, 확인할수 있는 구조가 됩니다.
A+B = 3, D+F+K = 1064 ....
이런식으로 16개의 선택항목중 어떤것이 선택되었고 선택되지 않았는지를
10진수의 숫자로 구분이 가능하다는 것이죠. 그럼 실제 예제로 사용해보겠습니다. 다중선택 페이지 1.php &lt;?php $aMultiSelect = Array ( "1"=&gt;"A","2"=&gt;"B","4"=&gt;"C","8"=&gt;"D", "16"=&gt;"E","32"=&gt;"F","64"=&gt;"G","128"=&gt;"H", "256"=&gt;"I","512"=&gt;"J","1024"=&gt;"K","2048"=&gt;"L", "4096"=&gt;"M","8192"=&gt;"N","16384"=&gt;"O","32768"=&gt;"P" ); echo " &lt;form method=post action='2.php'&gt;"; foreach ($aMultiSelect as $sKey =&gt; $sVal) { echo " &lt;input type='checkbox' name='multiselect[]' value='$sKey'&gt;$sVal&lt;br /&gt;"; } echo " &lt;input type='submit' value='submit'&gt; &lt;/form&gt;"; ?&gt; 저는 여기서 A D E를 선택했습니다. 선택되어진 값을 + 하여 DB에 저장하는 페이지 2.php &lt;?php $sSum = 0; foreach ($_POST[multiselect] as $sKey=&gt;$sVal) { &nbsp; $sSum += $sVal; } //$sSum 을 DB에 저장, A D E를 선택했으니 25겠죠 ?&gt; DB에서 값을 찾을때...
A(1), B(2), C(4)중 하나라도 포함된것을 찾으려고 합니다.
1+2+4 = 7 이므로
select * from 테이블 where 필드&amp;7&gt;0;
AND(&amp;) 연산은 각 자릿수를 비교해, 두값에 모두 1이 있을 때에만 1을 반환합니다.
0000 0000 0001 1001 25 &lt;== DB에 저장되어 있는 형태
0000 0000 0000 0111 7 &lt;== 비교값 0000 0000 0000 0001 1 결과값 1은 0 보다 크거나 같기에 좀전에 저장했던 데이터가 출력될것입니다.
그러면 D, E 두개다 저장된것을 찾고 싶을 때도 잇을겁니다.
이때는 8+16 = 24 이므로
select * from 테이블 where bit_count(필드&amp;24)=2;
0000 0000 0001 1001 25 &lt;== DB에 저장되어 있는 형태

여기서 bit_count는 2진수의 1의 갯수를 세었다고 생각하시면 됩니다.
D, E를 And 연산하여 참인것이 2개인것을 찾아라라는 말입니다. 그럼 And 와 or 가 같이 들어가 있는걸 검색해보겠습니다.
쿼리고 where 필드 like '%A%' or (필드 like '%D%' and 필드 like '%E%')
보기만 해도 시간이 많이 걸릴 쿼리 같으시죠...
이걸 비트연산으로 바꾸면
select * from 테이블 where 필드&amp;1&gt;0 or bit_count(필드&amp;24)=2;
이와 같이 바뀌게 됩니다. 이와같은 비트연산은 속도 뿐만 아니라 쿼리도 간단히 할수 있고 구조적으로도 관리하기가 편합니다.
그래서 비트연산을 사용하는것이죠 간만에 적으니 두서없이 생각나는대로 막 적은것 같습니다.
그래도 도움이 되었으면 좋겠네요. ^^]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/works/dbms/dbms_mysql에서의-비트연산-활용-예시.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Works/DBMS/DBMS_MySQL에서의 비트연산 활용 예시.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 01:23:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Flutter 개발 환경 설정]]></title><description><![CDATA[아래는 Flutter 개발 환경 설정을 위한 완성된 문서입니다. 이 문서는 Flutter SDK 설치부터 Android SDK 설정, flutter doctor를 통한 환경 설정 확인까지 포함하고 있습니다.Flutter는 하나의 코드베이스로 iOS와 Android 앱을 개발할 수 있는 강력한 프레임워크입니다. 이 문서에서는 Flutter 개발 환경을 설정하는 방법을 단계별로 자세히 설명하겠습니다.
Flutter SDK 설치
IDE 설치 및 설정
Android SDK 설정
flutter doctor로 환경 설정 확인
모바일 에뮬레이터 설정
Flutter 프로젝트 생성 및 실행 Flutter 공식 웹사이트(<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://flutter.dev/)%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://flutter.dev/)%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C" target="_self">https://flutter.dev/)에서</a> 운영체제에 맞는 Flutter SDK를 다운로드합니다. Windows: .zip 파일
macOS: .dmg 파일
Linux: .tar.xz 파일 다운로드한 파일의 압축을 원하는 디렉터리로 해제합니다. 예시: C:\src\flutter (Windows), ~/flutter (macOS/Linux) Flutter SDK를 시스템 PATH에 추가하여 터미널에서 Flutter 명령어를 쉽게 실행할 수 있도록 합니다.
시스템 속성 -&gt; 고급 시스템 설정 -&gt; 환경 변수를 엽니다.
사용자 변수 또는 시스템 변수의 Path를 선택하고 편집을 클릭합니다.
Flutter SDK의 bin 폴더 경로를 추가합니다. 예시: C:\src\flutter\bin 터미널에 다음 명령어를 입력하여 .bashrc, .bash_profile, 또는 .zshrc 파일에 Flutter 경로를 추가합니다.export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
변경 사항을 적용하기 위해 터미널을 재시작하거나 source ~/.bashrc를 실행합니다.Flutter가 올바르게 설치되었는지 확인하기 위해 flutter doctor 명령어를 사용합니다.flutter doctor
이 명령어는 Flutter 설치 상태를 진단하고 필요한 추가 설치 항목을 안내합니다.Flutter 개발을 위해 주로 사용하는 IDE는 다음과 같습니다:
Visual Studio Code: 가볍고 빠르며, Flutter 플러그인을 통해 강력한 지원을 제공합니다.
Android Studio: 전체적인 Android 개발 도구와 통합되어 있으며, 강력한 디버깅 기능과 에뮬레이터 지원을 제공합니다. <br>Visual Studio Code 다운로드 및 설치: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_self">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a> 에서 다운로드합니다.
Flutter 플러그인 설치: VS Code를 실행한 후, 왼쪽 사이드바에서 Extensions 아이콘을 클릭합니다.
"Flutter"와 "Dart" 플러그인을 검색하여 설치합니다. Flutter 프로젝트 생성: View -&gt; Command Palette -&gt; Flutter: New Project를 선택하여 새로운 Flutter 프로젝트를 생성합니다. <br>Android Studio 다운로드 및 설치: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_self">https://developer.android.com/studio</a> 에서 다운로드합니다.
Flutter 플러그인 설치: Android Studio를 실행하고, Plugins 메뉴로 이동하여 "Flutter" 플러그인을 설치합니다. 이는 Dart 플러그인을 자동으로 설치해줍니다. Android SDK 설치: Android Studio에서 SDK Manager를 열어 Android SDK, SDK Platform, 그리고 Android Virtual Device (AVD)를 설치합니다. Flutter 프로젝트 생성: File -&gt; New -&gt; New Flutter Project를 선택하여 새로운 Flutter 프로젝트를 생성합니다. Flutter는 Android SDK Command-line tools가 필요합니다. 이를 설치하기 위해 다음 단계를 따릅니다. Android Studio 실행: Android Studio를 실행합니다. SDK Manager 열기: File -&gt; Settings (macOS에서는 Preferences)로 이동한 후, Appearance &amp; Behavior -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Android SDK를 선택합니다. SDK Tools 탭 선택: SDK Tools 탭으로 이동합니다. Android SDK Command-line tools 체크: 목록에서 Android SDK Command-line tools (latest)를 선택합니다.
체크박스에 체크가 되어 있지 않다면, 체크하고 Apply 버튼을 눌러 설치를 진행합니다. 설치 확인: 설치가 완료되면 OK 버튼을 눌러 설정을 저장합니다. Flutter 개발 환경이 올바르게 설정되었는지 확인하려면, 터미널에서 다음 명령어를 실행합니다.flutter doctor
flutter doctor는 다음과 같은 사항들을 점검합니다:
Flutter SDK 설치 여부
Android SDK 설치 여부
Xcode 설치 여부 (macOS에서만)
Android Studio 및 Flutter/Dart 플러그인 설치 여부
연결된 디바이스(에뮬레이터 또는 실제 디바이스) 여부
각 항목의 상태가 출력되며, X 마크가 있는 경우 해당 항목에 문제가 있음을 나타냅니다. 문제가 발생한 경우 Flutter는 그에 따른 해결 방법을 제안합니다.만약 flutter doctor 출력에서 Android SDK Command-line tools와 관련된 문제가 발생한 경우, 위에서 설명한 대로 SDK Tools 탭에서 Android SDK Command-line tools (latest)를 설치했는지 확인하고, 설치 후 flutter doctor를 다시 실행합니다.
AVD Manager 실행: Android Studio에서 AVD Manager를 엽니다 (Tools -&gt; Device Manager). 새로운 가상 장치 생성: Create Virtual Device 버튼을 클릭하고, 원하는 기기 유형과 Android 버전을 선택하여 새로운 가상 장치를 만듭니다. 에뮬레이터 실행: 생성한 가상 장치를 선택하고 Play 버튼을 눌러 에뮬레이터를 실행합니다. Xcode 설치: Mac App Store에서 Xcode를 다운로드하고 설치합니다. Xcode 설정: Xcode를 실행하고 Preferences -&gt; Locations 탭에서 Command Line Tools를 설정합니다. iOS 시뮬레이터 실행: Xcode의 Window -&gt; Devices and Simulators에서 iOS 시뮬레이터를 실행할 수 있습니다. Flutter 프로젝트를 생성하여 환경 설정이 제대로 동작하는지 테스트합니다.flutter create my_flutter_app
생성한 Flutter 프로젝트 디렉터리로 이동한 후, 앱을 실행합니다.cd my_flutter_app
flutter run
flutter doctor를 통해 모든 환경이 제대로 설정되었음을 확인한 후, 앱이 정상적으로 실행되면 Flutter 개발 환경이 성공적으로 설정된 것입니다.
Hot Reload: 코드 변경 사항을 빠르게 적용하기 위해 터미널에서 r 키를 누릅니다.
Hot Restart: 전체 앱을 재시작하기 위해 R 키를 누릅니다.
이 문서에서 설명한 단계를 따라 Flutter 개발 환경을 성공적으로 설정할 수 있습니다. flutter doctor 명령어를 통해 환경 설정이 올바르게 되었는지 확인하고, 필요한 경우 추가 설정을 적용하세요. 이제 Flutter의 다양한 위젯과 플러그인을 활용하여 본격적으로 앱 개발을 시작할 수 있습니다.<br>MOC:: <a data-href="📚 630 Programming" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📚 630 Programming</a> | <a data-href="📚 634 Software Development" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📚 634 Software Development</a> | <a data-href="📚 637 Mobile App Development" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📚 637 Mobile App Development</a><br>Depart. :: <a data-href="👤 2.

All modern browsers have a threaded scrolling feature to permit scrolling to run smoothly even when expensive
JavaScript is running, but this optimization is partially defeated by the need to wait for the results of<br>
any touchstart and touchmove handlers, which may prevent the scroll entirely by calling <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/#the-touchstart-event" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/#the-touchstart-event" target="_self"><code></code></a>preventDefault() on the event. While there are particular scenarios where an author may indeed want to prevent scrolling, analysis indicates that the majority of touch event handlers on the web never actually
call preventDefault(), so browsers often block scrolling unnecessarily. For instance, in Chrome for Android 80% of the touch events that block scrolling never actually prevent it. 10% of these events add more than 100ms of delay to the start of scrolling, and a catastrophic delay of at least 500ms occurs in 1% of scrolls.<br>Many developers are surprised to learn that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://rbyers.github.io/janky-touch-scroll.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="http://rbyers.github.io/janky-touch-scroll.html" target="_self">simply adding an empty touch handler to their document</a> can have a<br>
significant negative impact on scroll performance. Developers quite reasonably expect that the act of observing an event <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#observing-event-listeners" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#observing-event-listeners" target="_self">should not have any side-effects</a>.<br>The fundamental problem here is not limited to touch events. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#events-wheelevents" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#events-wheelevents" target="_self"><code></code> events</a>wheel<br>
suffer from an identical issue. In contrast, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/" target="_self">pointer event handlers</a> are
designed to never delay scrolling (though developers can declaratively suppress scrolling altogether with the touch-action CSS property), so do not suffer from this issue. Essentially the passive event listener proposal brings the performance properties of pointer events to touch and wheel events.<br>This proposal provides a way for authors to indicate at handler registration time whether the handler may call preventDefault() on the event (i.e. whether it needs an event that is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-cancelable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-cancelable" target="_self">cancelable</a>). When no touch or wheel handlers at a particular point require a cancelable event, a user agent is free to start scrolling immediately without waiting for JavaScript. That is, passive listeners are free from surprising performance side-effects.First, we need a mechanism for attaching additional information to an event listener. Today the capture argument to addEventListener is the closest example of something like this, but its usage is pretty opaque: document.addEventListener('touchstart', handler, true);
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dictdef-eventlisteneroptions" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dictdef-eventlisteneroptions" target="_self"><code></code></a>EventListenerOptions lets us write this more explicitly as: document.addEventListener('touchstart', handler, {capture: true});
<br>This is simply the new (extensible) syntax for existing behavior - specifying <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing#capturing" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing#capturing" target="_self">whether you want the listener invoked during the capture phase or bubbling phase</a>.Now that we have an extensible syntax for specifying options at event handler registration time, we can add a new passive option which declares up-front that the listener will never call preventDefault() on the event. If it does, the user agent will just ignore the request (ideally generating at least a console warning), as it already does for events with Event.cancelable=false. A developer can verify this by querying Event.defaultPrevented before and after calling preventDefault(). Eg: addEventListener(document, "touchstart", function(e) { console.log(e.defaultPrevented); // will be false e.preventDefault(); // does nothing since the listener is passive console.log(e.defaultPrevented); // still false }, Modernizr.passiveeventlisteners ? {passive: true} : false);
<br>Now rather than having to block scrolling whenever there are any touch or wheel listener, the browser only needs to do this when there are non-passive listeners (see <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#cancelability" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="http://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#cancelability" target="_self">TouchEvents spec</a>). passive listeners are free of performance side-effects.By marking a touch or wheel listener as passive, the developer is promising the handler won't call preventDefault to disable scrolling. This frees the browser up to respond to scrolling immediately without waiting for JavaScript, thus ensuring a reliably smooth scrolling experience for the user.<br>Because older browsers will interpret any object in the 3rd argument as a true value for the capture argument, it's important for developers to use feature detection or <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4" target="_self">a polyfill</a> when using this API, to avoid unforeseen results. Feature detection for specific options can be done as follows:// Test via a getter in the options object to see if the passive property is accessed
var supportsPassive = false;
try { var opts = Object.defineProperty({}, 'passive', { get: function() { supportsPassive = true; } }); window.addEventListener("testPassive", null, opts); window.removeEventListener("testPassive", null, opts);
} catch (e) {} // Use our detect's results. passive applied if supported, capture will be false either way.
elem.addEventListener('touchstart', fn, supportsPassive ? { passive: true } : false); <br>To make this simpler you can use the feature detect from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rafrex/detect-it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/rafrex/detect-it" target="_self">Detect It</a>, eg: elem.addEventListener('touchstart', fn, detectIt.passiveEvents ? {passive:true} : false);
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://modernizr.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://modernizr.com/" target="_self">Modernizr</a> also has a detect <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1982" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1982" target="_self">here</a>. There is an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/107" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/107" target="_self">open standards debate</a> around providing a simpler API for dictionary member feature detection.There are scenarios where an author may intentionally want to consistently disable scrolling by cancelling all touch or wheel events. These include:
Panning and zooming a map
Full-page/full-screen games
In these cases, the current behavior (which prevents scrolling optimization) is perfectly adequate, since scrolling itself is being prevented consistently. There is no need to use passive listeners in these cases, though it's often still a good idea to apply a touch-action: none CSS rule to make your intention explicit (eg. supporting browsers with Pointer Events but not Touch Events). However, in a number of common scenarios events don't need to block scrolling - for instance:
User activity monitoring which just wants to know when the user was last active
touchstart handlers that hide some active UI (like tooltips)
touchstart and touchend handlers that style UI elements (without suppressing the click event).
For these scenarios, the passive option can be added (with appropriate feature detection) without any other code changes, resulting in a significantly smoother scrolling experience.There are a few more complicated scenarios where the handler only wants to suppress scrolling under certain conditions, such as:
Swiping horizontally to rotate a carousel, dismiss an item or reveal a drawer, while still permitting vertical scrolling. <br>In this case, use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action" target="_self">touch-action: pan-y</a> to declaratively disable scrolling that starts along the horizontal axis without having to call preventDefault() (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://rbyers.github.io/touch-action.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://rbyers.github.io/touch-action.html" target="_self">test page</a>).
To continue to work correctly in all browsers, calls to preventDefault should be conditional on the lack of support for the particular touch-action rule being used (note that Safari 9 currently only supports touch-action: manipulation). A UI element (like YouTube's volume slider) which slides on horizontal wheel events without changing the scrolling behavior on vertical wheel events. Since there is no equivalent of "touch-action" for wheel events, this case can only be implemented with non-passive wheel listeners.
Event delegation patterns where the code that adds the listener won't know if the consumer will cancel the event. One option here is to do delegation separately for passive and non-passive listeners (as if they were different event types entirely).
<br>It's also possible to leverage touch-action as above (treating Touch Events as you would <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/" target="_self">Pointer Events</a>. <br>You can get a quick idea of the benefit possible (and potential breakage) by forcing touch/wheel listeners to be treated as passive via chrome://flags/#passive-listener-default (new in Chrome 52). This makes it easy to do your own side-by-side comparisons like <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://twitter.com/RickByers/status/719736672523407360" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://twitter.com/RickByers/status/719736672523407360" target="_self">this popular video</a>.<br>See <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-D_3yx_KVI" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-D_3yx_KVI" target="_self">this video</a> for tips on how to use Chrome's Developer Tools to identify listeners that are blocking scrolling.

이 상인은 여러 가지 진귀한 물건들을 팔았는데 그 중에는 ‘책’이라는 것도 있었다. 지금 생각하면 조잡하기 짝이 없던 그 책은 어린 나의 호기심을 크게 자극했다. 이 상인은 설명하기를 이 책이라는 것 안에는 또 다른 세상이 있고 이 책이 바로 그 다른 세상을 엿볼 수 있게 해주는 거울과 진배없는 물건이라고 했다. 이것이 정말 대단한 물건이어서 였는지 값이 비쌌다. 삼대독자의 죽는 시늉까지 보고 나서야 부모님은 이 책을 사 주셨다. 아쉽게도 이 거울은 보는 법마저 알아야 하는 귀찮은 물건이었다. 마을에 글을 읽는 어른이 없던 탓에 이웃 마을까지 글을 배우러 다녔다. 산과 산을 넘어 글을 배우고 그 길을 다시 돌아오고 나면 서산 뒤에 해가 넘어가기 일쑤였다. 다른 세상을 보려는 일념 하에 그 길을 싫증 한번 내지 않고 다녔다. 딱 한 달이 지나 책을 읽는데 부족함이 없었다. 두어 달이 더 지나고 배우는 것에 싫증이 났다. 글 배우기를 끊고 책을 읽고 또 읽었다. 책은 여러 편의 이야기를, 즉 여러 세상을 가지고 있었다. 그중 내 맘을 사로잡은 것은 나잘에 관한 이야기였다. 와령에서 서쪽으로 끝없이 가면서 고된 여정의 목마름을 참고, 배고픔을 이겨내고 마침내 사람을 초월하면 세상의 끝에 닿을 수 있는데, 그곳이 바로 나잘이라 하였다. 나잘은 세상에서 가장 아름답다고 하였다. 세상에 있는 그 모든 것보다 아름다운 것들이 거기에 즐비하여 모자란 것이 하나 없다고 하였다. 사람 또한 모자람이 없어야 그곳에 닿을 수 있다고 했다. 나는 나잘은 어떤 곳일까 상상하는 한편, 그곳에 갈 수 있는 사람이란 어떤 사람인지를 한평생 머리에 그리고 지우기를 반복하곤 했다.나의 아비가 그러했듯, 나는 별난 사고 없이 자라 또 부모가 되고, 근근이 물려받은 가산을 까먹으며 소일하는 별 볼일 없는 한량이 되어 가고 있었다. 당시의 나는 꽤나 따분한 일상에 진력이 나고 매사에 통 의욕이 없는 인간이었다. 눈만 깨어 있다면 술을 자주 먹고ㅡ아내가 경영하는 주막 덕에 술은 원 없이 먹을 수 있었다ㅡ, 간간이 시답잖은 글을 쓰고, 마을에 비슷한 처지의 한량들, 그 정말 봐주려야 별 봐줄 구석 없는 시답잖은 벗들과 시시한 농담이나 나누는 게 내가 하던 대사大事의 전부라고 해도 몹시 틀린 말은 아닐 거다. 이따금은 그들과 나잘에 관해 이야기하였다. 몇은 흰소리라 잡아뗐고, 몇은 으레 동조하는 기색이 있었다. 허나 그 몇이 정말 나잘을 믿었느냐하면 그것은 전연 다른 이야기일 테다. 왜냐면 내가 그런 이야기를 꺼낼 때는 꼭 내가 대접하는 자리에서였고 그때마다 그들은 한 귀로 듣고 한 귀로 흘리는 양 대수롭지 않게 받아주는 식이었기 때문이다. 그러나 내가 그런 벗들의 태도에 일일이 화를 내지 않은 건 그들을 무식하다고 생각하기도 했거니와 실상 나의 마음의 한편에도 나잘에 대한 의심이 끊임없이 있던 탓이다.모자라는 것이 없다는 건 말하자면 정말 이상한 말이다. 적어도 내가 나고 자라며 보아온 모든 사물과 사람 간에는 통 그런 것을 볼 수가 없고 앞으로 볼 수 있을 거란 희망 따위도 작디작기만 해 말하기가 우습다. 가령 우리 고장의 북쪽에 꼭 사흘 길을 가면 닿을 수 있는 백산이라는 유명한 산을 이야기하자면, 많은 여행객이 그 소문을 듣고 방방곡곡에서 유람을 오고 그 풍채를 찬양하곤 하건만 여기 나고 자란 우리들 마을 사람의 눈과 귀에는 그 말이 영 옳게 보이고 들리지는 않는 것이다. 일단 나부터도 굳이 그 산을 더 가까이 두고 보겠다며 한번 찾아가 본 일이 없으니, 전국의 객들이 영험하게 여기는 백산을 함부로 폄하하지는 않으면서도 굳이 그들에게 맞장구를 치며 ‘그 얼마나 대단한 위용입니까!’ 라든지, ‘죽기 전에는 꼭 한 번 보고 죽어야 될 만큼 절경이지요.’ 라는 말 따위는 하지 못하는 것이다. 이는 말하자면 사물에 가치를 두는 기준이나 또 두게 되는 양이 사람 저마다 각각으로 다름이다. 사물에도 이러할 진데 사람에게야. 그러므로 혹여 그 누구나 이견 없이 동의할 수 있는 나잘이 있거든 그 안에 사람이 있어서는 안 되는 얘기다. 흠이 없어 보이는 것도 흠이 있게 만들 수 있는 게 사람이 아닌가.내가 ‘오’를 만난 것은 와령으로 불리는 마을에서였다. 허름한 주막에 들러 식사를 주문하고 넌지시 주모에게 나잘에 대한 운을 띄웠다.“혹여 나잘이 어디로 가야 닿는지 아시는가?” 물으니 주모는 한바탕 웃더니,“하도 들어서 알긴 압니다만 그건 왜 물으신답니까?”나는 적잖이 놀라,“그럼 거기에 다녀온 사람이 있단 얘긴가?” 라고 물었다.주모는“나잘에 갔다 왔다던 영감님이 있었는데, 벌써 죽고 없는걸.”“그게 언제적 얘긴가?”“그 글쟁이 할배 죽은지가 오륙년쯤 됐는가, 근데 그건 왜 물으시우, 설마 거길 가볼라고?”그 얘길 듣고 정신이 번쩍 들고 나잘 얘기가 흘러나온 출처가 몹시도 궁금하였으나 그보다도 자존심이 먼저 튀어나와서,“갈 수만 있다면 안 갈 이유 없지.” 말을 뱉고 말았다.이 갈보 같은 여편네는 주책없이 또 한 번 크게 웃었다.“그 영감님 술주정하던 얘긴 애들도 안 믿는 걸, 애들도 안 믿을 얘길 다 큰 양반이. 안 그래두 그쪽으로 가서 돌아오지 않은 사람도 몇 되고, 다녀간 사람이 몇몇 되는데 가도 가도 모래뿐이랍디다. 온통 물천지인 데를 갖다가 바다라고 부른다 하던데 그래서 다들 그쪽을 모래바다라고 얼씬도 안하는 걸. 근데 그 영감님은 맨날 안 돌아오는 사람들이 나잘에 도착해서 신선놀음을 하느라 오지 않는다라나, 영감 말이 자기는 이 좋은 데를 다른 사람도 알게 해주려고 돌아왔다는데, 돌아오고 나서는 도통 나잘 가는 길이 보이지 아니 한답디다. 아니, 뭐 가긴 어딜 그런 데를 가서 신선놀음을 한답디까. 그 말 믿고 갔던 사람들 다 죽어서 저승 바닥에 나부러졌겠지.”하고는 쪼르륵 달려간다.비위가 상할 대로 상했으나 시장한 탓에 나중에 주모가 내온 음식은 기가 막힌 별미였다. 반주를 곁들여 식사를 하고 있는데 골격에 비하여 몸매가 초췌하고 혈색조차 좋지 않아 뵈는 청년이 옆을 기웃기웃 거리는가 싶더니 와서 말을 붙인다.“나잘을 찾아 가십니까?”“어린 애도 안 갈 데를 가겠는가?” 힐끗 주모를 쳐다보니 음식을 준비하는데 여념이 없다. 나는 이 청년을 다시 보고 이렇게 말했다.“그런 걸 왜 묻는가?”“있다고 하는 사람도 못 믿을 만하지만, 그렇다고 없다고 하는 사람 말이 또 옳은지도 모르겠습니다.”“눈으로 보면 확실할 텐데. 사람 말이 다 그렇잖은가, 어디 믿을 구석들이 있어야지. 그런데 나잘이라함은 가장 아름다운 것만 넘치는 곳이라 하거늘, 그런 곳이 세상에 어찌 있을 수 있겠나.”청년은 가만히 있다가,“가장 더러운 것이 있는데 가장 아름다운 곳은 없겠습니까.” 라고 답했다.나는 퍽 기분이 좋아져서 말했다.“더러운 몸을 하고서 그런 곳에 가기 무섭네.”청년은 말했다.“더러운 곳에서 더럽지 않을 사람이 어디 있으며, 아름다운 곳에서 아름답지 못할 사람이 어디에 있겠습니까?”나는 원하던 답을 얻은 듯이 기뻤다.“조금 취하거든 자네 말을 이해할 것도 같은데 한 잔 하지.”그제야 나는 이 청년의 눈을 다시금 볼 수 있었다. 행색은 초라해도 참으로 또렷한 눈동자다. 신념이 엿보이는 듯 형형한 불씨가 그 안에 타고 있었다. 함께 술을 몇 잔 주고받으며 그날은 나잘에 당도한 마냥 흠뻑 취해 기쁜 맘을 감출 수 없었다.그 후 며칠을 자신을 ‘오’라고 밝힌 청년과 함께 지내며 나잘에 관한 대화를 나누기도, 아니면 시시콜콜한 아무 쓰잘머리 없는 농을 주고받기도 하였다. 그러나 사연 없는 사람은 없다는 지론에 오의 사정을 캐묻지는 않았다. 오도 저의 얘기를 하기 보다는 가만히 듣고 앉아 있길 좋아하는 눈치이기도 하고 나는 떠들고 떠들어도 또 떠들 거리가 남은 사람이라 모처럼 잡은 기회를 놓치지 않고 한바탕 떠벌이는 중이었다. 나는 남의 흉보기를 좋아하는 사람이다. 내가 사람들이 얼마나 못 배우고 멍청한지 일장연설을 하다가 은근슬쩍 내 자랑을 끼워 넣게 되면 오는 으레 ‘저도 못 배운 처지에 말씀 듣고 나니 느끼는 게 많습니다.’라거나 ‘확실히 사람은 배워야 마땅히 쓸 데가 있는 모양입니다.’라며 맞장구를 쳐줬다. 이건 내 흥을 돋우고 내 등에 날개를 돋게 만드는 일이었다. 대화가 통하는 벗을 만나기가 어찌 쉬운 일이랴. 그렇게 얘기를 쏟고 또 쏟는 동안 낮과 밤이 수차례 바뀌었다. 밤이면 다음 날이 기다려졌다. 와령으로 가기 전에 이렇게 나와 한 짝으로 꿰어진 버선 같은 사람을 만났으니 앞으로의 전망 또한 저 달처럼 눈부시리라는 기대를 하며 잠을 청하곤 했다.물론 세상 모든 일이 그렇듯 마냥 좋기만 한 것은 아녔다. 어느 날 한번은 술을 마시다가 나는 기분이 부쩍 좋아 오에게 이렇게 말했다.“이렇게 술을 마시고 담소를 나누니 참 좋다가도 뭔가 모자란 낌새가 통 있지 말이야. 허긴 음양에 모름지기 조화가 있어야 만사가 화평한 법인데. 여보게, 오. 요 근처에 기생집에 가보련?”그러자 오는 씁쓸한 웃음을 지으며 대답했다.“여기서 얘기나 하고, 먹고, 술이나 마시면 더 뭐가 필요하겠습니까? 자꾸 얻어먹는 염치에 이것도 다 죄송한데... 흥미두 없구요.”“아니, 주막이란 것도 객들의 허기를 풀어주고 하느라 이렇게 길목에다가 장사를 차린 건데, 꼭 허기란 게 배곯은 것만 얘기하는 건 아니거든. 그 기생들도 다 객들의 허기를 풀어주려고 아랫도리에 장사를 차린 것이니 주막이나 기생집이나 다를 건 무언가? 내 노자는 넉넉히 있으니 자네 몫을 못 대주려구.”그러자 오는 별 대답 없이 허허 웃기만 하고 미적거린다. 나는 즉시 냉큼 나의 말에 따라주지 않는 어린놈에게 심통이 났음이다. 오를 허우대만 큰 어린애라 얕잡고 만만하게 여기는 마음이 들었다.우리가 나잘을 향해 떠나기로 합의를 본 건 그렇게 근 한 달을 주막 근처에서 더 머문 후의 일이다. 오는 처음 볼 적에 일면 수척했던 모습은 온데간데없고 튼실한 장정으로 변해 있었다. 그는 짐꾼을 자청했는데 그 말이 맘에 쏙 들었다. 마침 마을에는 서북쪽으로 두 달을 가야 있다는 AA로 교역하러 가는 무리가 들렀다. 그전까지 길을 떠날 확연한 계획도 없다가 그 무리의 소문을 듣고 즉시 계획 아닌 계획을 만들어 그 무리의 수장쯤 되는 사람과 협상을 했다. 결국 사례금을 좀 쥐어주고 방향이 맞는 곳까지만 동행하다가 중간에 헤어지기로 얘기가 되었다. 무리중의 몇이 나를 만류하는 소리를 했지만 영 듣기 싫었다. 아무튼 길가는 요령이라든가 하는 게 있다면 좀 일러주고, 필요한 물건을 챙겨달라고 돈을 넉넉히 쥐어주니 그 몇도 더는 가타부타 말하지 않았다. 그렇게 나의 임의로 모든 걸 준비했다. 사실 계획이랄 것도 없이 막연히 나잘에 가겠다는 확고한 목표만 있었으므로 그 외의 것이 눈에 들어올 리도 없었다. 오는 좋다 싫다 말을 하지 않았다.그렇게 함께 무리와 길을 떠나 딱 열흘째가 되는 날, 막 그 모래바다가 서쪽으로 펼쳐진 게 허언이 아니었단 사실을 확인한 자리에서 우리는 헤어졌다. 잡다한 물건과 식량 등이 담긴 꾸러미를 건네 받고 작별인사를 마쳤는데 그 무리 몇몇은 아직도 영 걱정스런 눈치였다. 한 사내가 나에게 고된 여정이 될 것이니 혹여 조그마한 문제라도 생기거든 즉시 돌아가기를 권고하더니 못미더운 얼굴로 떠났다. 오는 이미 꾸러미 안을 확인하고 그대로 들쳐 메어 준비를 끝냈다.변변한 대비랄 것도 없이 의욕만 충만하여 길을 나선 어리석음은 금방 화로 돌아왔다. 나잘까지의 거리는 당초 예상한 것을 크게 웃돌아 먹을 식량은 거의 바닥이 나고 꼼짝없이 모래 위에 객사할 팔자가 되었다. 내 몸 상태가 급격하게 나빠져서 오가 몇 번이나 돌아갈 것을 청했지만 내가 고집을 부리며 발을 돌리지 않은 탓에 이렇게 되었다. 오는 도중에 아직 힘이 남았을 적에는 곧잘 이유도 없이 오에게 성질을 내곤 했지만 그쯤 되니 애꿎은 오에게 화풀이를 해보려도 화낼 기력조차 없다. 하기야 오가 놈이야 자기는 괜찮답시고 내가 산 식량이니 내가 먹는 게 당연하다며 저 먹을 거까지 내 입에 밀어 넣었으니 상태가 나보다 더하면 더했지 못할 리는 없었다. 내가 정신이 오락가락하는 통에 못된 일을 할 뻔했다. 기력이 없는 것이 참 다행이라고 속으로 읊는다. 따지고 보면 이 모든 일이 내가 자초한 것임은 무어래도 자명하다. 그러므로 군소리 않고 따르는 오가에게 오히려 내가 절을 하면 했어야 하는 게 도리에 맞다. 그러나 이렇게 자책하는 맘이 있다가도 도무지 막막하기 이를 데 없는 지금의 상황을 생각하면 또 짜증이 버럭 나는 것이다. 나는 끝내 노쇠한 나귀 울음처럼 힘없는 한마디를 올려붙인다.“어휴, 이런 재주 없는 놈하고...”속으로 실언을 했다 생각했지만 이미 뱉어진 말을 체면상 돌릴 수 없다. 나는 괜히 눈치를 볼 수밖에 없다. 오가 놈이야 지금 짐을 다 짊어지고 걸어서 한마디 대꾸할 기력도 없지만 한 번 성을 내면 이런 사십이 다 되어가는 늙은이쯤은 대번에 거꾸러뜨릴 장정임은 틀림없는 사실이다. 나는 몹시 무서운 상상을 하고야 말았다.‘혹여 이놈이 맘을 바꿔먹고 나를 죽이고 내 품에 남은 돈을 들고 달아나면, 아니 날 잡아 먹기라도 하면 이 허허벌판 누구라고 이런 진상을 알까.’순간 오금이 저리고 정신이 핑 돌았다. 일순간 다리를 헛디뎌 자빠지자 앞서 가던 오가 낌새를 알고 달려온다. 나는 돌연 안심하는 마음이 들어 마른 눈물이 날 것만 같았다. 고마운 녀석이다.“괜찮으십니까?”나는 대답 대신 고개를 끄덕이고 아예 대자로 누워 버렸다. 깜빡 잠이 들었다.오 녀석의 등이 보였다. 어깨가 들썩이고 앉은 것이 아무래도 수상한 모습이다. 조용히 뒤로 다가가 보니 글쎄 이 녀석은 기름이 잔뜩 떨어지는 닭다리를 하나 붙들고 게걸스럽게 뜯고 있었다. 미움과 화가 마음에 불처럼 번진다. 나도 모르게 이 녀석을 뒷머리를 후려치려고 팔을 힘껏 휘둘렀다. 분명, 분명 그랬을 진데 팔은 요동도 않는다. 내 어깨를 보니 팔 없이 휑한 기괴한 모양새다. 순간 번개를 맞은 듯 놀라 잠에서 깼다.눈에 피가 몰린다. 마른 몸을 짜고 짜내어 눈가에 눈물이 맺혔다. 곁에는 오가 묵묵히 앉아 눈을 감고 있었다. 오의 얼굴을 살피니 아무래도 노곤한 기색이었다. 잠이 든 건지 단순히 명상을 하는 지 알 수가 없다. 처음에 만났을 적에 활력이 넘치던 장정은 온 데 간 데 없고 한 십년쯤의 세월이 누구도 모르는 사이 그의 몸을 침투하여 장악해버린 것만 같았다. 미안한 마음이 가슴을 쓸고 세차게 움켜쥐어 헛기침을 해버렸다. 오가 눈을 뜨더니,“일어나셨습니까? 뭐라도 좀 찾았으면 싶은데요.”“주위에 뭐가 있어야 말이지...”말끝을 흐리고 주변을 둘러본다. 이때까지 질리게 본 풍경에 질식할 듯 정신이 아찔하다. 어쩌면 이 모래벌판이 우리가 걷는 동안 우리와 같은 속도로 후퇴하여 우릴 가뒀다는 착각마저 들 정도로. 바람이 불어 먼지 자욱하게 산발된 머리를 빗어 넘기기 전까지 우리는 한동안 서로 말이 없었다.이튿날, 아무런 기대와 희망 없이 또 밝아온 개벽에 나는 일찍이 깨어 헛헛한 기침만 하고는 ‘나잘 가는 길은 모르겠거니와 죽는 길은 확실히 보이는 것도 같은데...’ 라고 혼잣말을 했다. 몸이 제대로 움직일 것 같지 않았다. 육신이 더없이 무거워지고 나니 정말로 죽음을 목전에 둔 마냥 마음이 함께 무거웠다. 무력감은 이루 말할 수가 없다. 오가 이미 깨어 있는 줄은 몰랐으나 그 말을 듣고 그는 남쪽으로 방향을 틀자고 제안했다. 그쪽으로 간다면 자기가 아는 바로 틀림없이 바다를 향해 치달리는 강이 서남쪽으로부터 자신의 고향 마을까지 길게 뻗었다고 하였다. 이쯤 되니 나잘이 죽어서야 닿는 곳인가 망상도 제법 들고 제대로 된 생각은 일절 할 수 없으며 몸이 단지 애타게 물을 갈구하여 대답도 없이 발이 먼저 남을 향해 돌아갔다.그 후로는 단 한마디의 대화 없이 오가 길을 인도하고 나는 내 발만 쳐다보며 걸었다. 그렇게 얼마쯤 했을까 나는 정신을 잃었다. 얼마가 또 지났는지 알 수 없다. 몇 번을 꿈에서 사지가 다 잘린 꼴이 되어 버둥거리다가 소스라치며 오의 등 위에서 깨곤 했다. 제 몸을 제가 못 가누니 사지 없는 병신과 다름없다. 제 꼴이 우습다. 차라리 죽어 버리지. 그리고 몸이 말라 사지가 마른 나뭇가지처럼 맥없이, 앙상하게 늘어졌을 때, 이미 반쯤은 스스로 걷는 게 아니라 운반되어온 입장에서, 그나마도 먹은 게 없어 무게가 덜 나가니 다행이라며 자조하는 그런 입장에서 다시 한 번 생각해보자면, 그때 오가 왜 나를 버려두고 가지 않았는가는 아무래도, 죽었다 깨나도 정녕 영문 모를 일이었다.얼마의 시간이 흘렀을까, 이제는 제법 정신이 깰 때마다 풍경이 바뀌는 게 눈에 들어왔다. 풀 한 포기 없던 모래판에서 드디어 벗어나자 살 수 있다는 생각이 스멀스멀 기어 나왔다. 긴장이 풀리고 몸뚱이는 나른했지만 한 숟갈 희망을 맛본 몸이 먼저 삶의 낌새를 알아챘는지 이전에는 그냥 죽기만을 바라고 있더니 이때부터는 목이 타고 배가 고프다.어느 들판인가 마른 풀 위에 나를 뉘이고 오는 어디서 구해왔는지 작은 바가지에 물을 떠가지고 돌아왔다. 눈이 돌아갈 지경이었으므로 제대로 앉기도 전에 바가지에 입을 대고 물을 벌컥벌컥 들이켜니 오는 급하게 마시지 말라는 말을 하며 내 몸을 가뉘어 준다. 오는 몇 번을 더 물을 구하러 다녀오곤 먹을 걸 찾아본다며 다시금 사라졌다.가만히 누워있자니 기껏 마신 물이 화산 터지는 기세와 같이 눈에 치솟아 흐른다. 집이 그립고, 가족이 그립다. 싸리나무를 엮어 만든 우리 집 울타리가 그립고, 그 안에 드나드는 객들의 말소리가 그립다. 다듬이질하는 소리가 그립고, 해질녘에 노을을 따라 함께 흐르는 밥 짓는 연기가 그립다. 이따금 나를 지치게 했던 잔소리가 그립다. 사는 내내 헛소리와 실없는 농담만 하고 변변한 일도 하지 않던 남편을 만나, 식구 굶기지 않고 너끈히 한 가정의 생활을 견인해가던 아내의 모습이 그립다. 아이들이 그립다. 내 떠나기 전에 장가들 예정이었으니 곧 손주를 볼 수 있을 텐데, 아직 생전 보지도 못한 손주 얼굴마저 그립다. 정작 그들은 나를 그리워하지 않을 거란 생각에 서글프다. 너른 땅 위에 말도 아닌 꼴을 하고도 삶을 갈구하는 작은 인간을 발견했다.돌아온 오의 손에는 X(나중에 바꾸기)가 들려 있었다. 차마 말은 못하나 입안에 침이 고인다. 오는 불이 없으니 죽도 끓이질 못하고 다만 고르게 빻아 물과 섞어 나에게 건넨다. 식도를 타고 생명수가 흐르고 세상 어떤 진미도 이를 따를 수 없다. 그러나 한편 시름이 한줌은 섞인 듯 이 떨떨한 뒷맛은 무어냐. 아, 이것은 삶의 맛이다. 나는 비로소 살았다는 실감을 했다.밤을 보낼만한 장소로 옮긴 뒤, 모처럼의 활기가 생긴 나는 오와 대화를 나눴다. 그러던 중 이런 질문을 하게 되었다.“죽을 고비를 하고서는 별별 생각이 다 들더구먼, 옛 시절이 참 행복했던 거만 같구, 그래서 말인데. 오, 자네는 살면서 언제가 가장 행복했나?”오는 잠깐 머뭇거리더니,“아내와 함께 살던 때가 가장 행복했습죠.” 라고 답한다. 나는 궁금증이 일어,“자네 기생집 가잔 걸 시큰둥하길래 부끄럼 많은 숫총각으로만 알았는데, 장가를 들었나? 근데 어쩌다 이리 기구하게 됐나... 나도 마찬가지지만서두... 어쨌든 장가들고서 행복하단 사람을 일찍이 보질 못했는데 자네 아내는 어떤 사람인가?오는 잠시 생각하는 듯 하더니 말을 시작했다.“아내는 맑은 사람이었습니다. 같은 고을에서 한해 차이로 나고 자랐고 다섯 살 무렵부터 무척 아내를 귀하게 여겼습니다. 물론 같이 천하게 났다지만 그런 사정이야 어릴 시절에는 알지 못했고 다만 저의 마음에 한줌의 진심이란 것이 있었다면, 그 어려서부터 그 진심의 대부분은 아내를 위한 것이었습니다. 그 어리던 때의 어느 날, 곤충을 잡아 단순히 재미로 사지를 분해하곤 하던 어린아이들의, 순수함에 비례한 잔인함 딱 그 농도의 어린 아이들을 말하자면, 저와 누구도 의심하지 않던 단순한 놀이에, 그러니까 하나 특별하지 않은 어느 날 강변에 모여 아무 악의 없이 잠자리의 몸뚱어리를 분리하던 행동들에, 아, 아내가 울음을 터트렸습니다... 그랬더니만 다른 아이들은 이상히 여겼고, 저는 제 행동에 대한 수치심과 아내의 울음으로 비로소 상기된 잠자리에 대한 가엾음, 그리고 아내의 가엾음에 어쩔 줄을 몰랐습니다. 말주변이 없어 말이 옳게 되고 있는 줄을 모르겠습니다. 말이 말처럼 되지를 않는게 어디서부터 말해야할 지두 모르고... 아무튼 아내가 울던 그 직후에 무작정 그녀를 업고 마을로 돌아 왔습니다. 그리고 그 와중에 생각한 것이 있는데, 아내를, 그러니까 갓 네 살 난 아이를, 부끄럽습니다만 아무튼 다섯 살 먹은 꼬마 아이가 그 순수를 지켜주겠다고 속으로 맹세한 것입니다. 뭐, 참 어리석은 생각이었지요.그렇게 시간이 흐르는 동안, 항상 저보다 아내의 먹을 입을 걱정했고, 자다가 아내가 우는 꿈이라도 꾸면 새까만 밤을 달려, 밤중에도 훤히 길을 아는 것이 참 유난스러워 부끄럽습니다만, 하여간 제집 찾듯이 아내의 집을 찾아 기웃대며 무슨 일이 있진 않은가 노심초사했습니다. 아내는 말이 없는 사람이었고, 아마 옆에서 유난을 떠는 저 때문에 더 말이 없는 사람이 된 것 같습니다. 우리는 그러나 서로 행복하게 될 것을 의심해본 적이 없습니다. 어려서부터 마을사람들은 공공연히 우리를 ‘꼬마 부부’라고 불렀고, 다행히 두 집안 어른 분들도 그에 흡족해하셨기에 그렇게 혼기가 차는 대로 우리는 식을 올려 백년가약을 맺게 되었습니다. 그때의 기분은 참으로 설명하기가 어렵습니다. 천지신명이 우리를 축복하고 보살피어 큰 고난 없이 우리를 맺게 하셨고, 아내의 미소를 곁에 두고 살게 된 감복과 기쁨은, 옛 얘기로만 듣던 그 충성이 몹시 단단한 천군만마를 거느린 장군들의 마음과 조금도 다를 게 없었습니다.그렇게 하루하루의 기쁨이 세월에 밀려 조금도 덜어지지 않고 풍요로운, 물론 형편이 넉넉했던 것은 아닙니다만, 그러니까 풍요로운 충실감이라고 할까요. 이를테면 먹을 것이 부족한 날은 서로 양보하려고 말싸움 아닌 말싸움을 한다든가. 으레 저는 아내에게 언젠가 아이를 낳을 몸이니 더 먹어 두어 몸 안의 기운을 든든히 하여야 한다고 했고, 아내는 사내가 바깥활동을 하여 힘을 더 쓰게 되니 더 먹어야 한다고 하였습니다. 언제나 승자는 없었고 모자란 밥을 서로 나누어 먹었지만 고봉밥을 서너 그릇 먹은 듯 배가 부르곤 했습니다. 그런 날은 배가 너무 불러 더는 못 먹겠다며 짐짓 너스레를 떨며 배를 탕탕 치고는 남는 기운을 써야겠다며 아내를 괴롭히곤 했지요. 행복했습니다. 언제 가장 행복했는지를 스스로 잘 알고 있다는 게 참 잔인하고 괴롭긴 합니다만...”나는 오가 이렇듯 말을 오래하는 걸 처음 봤으므로 적잖이 놀랐을 뿐더러 오의 마지막 말이 의미심장해 다시금 재촉하며 물을 수 밖에 없었다.“허허, 그럼 자네는 나잘에 살았던 게로구만. 근데 어쩌다 출가를 한 겐가? 무슨 사정으루?”“아내가 죽었습니다.”“왜? 어쩌다가?”“그 이유라도 속 시원히 알면 조금은 덜 답답하고 덜 괴로울 텐데요...”나는 필시 말 못할 사연이 오에게 있음을 눈치 채고도 재차 채근하여 오의 입을 열게 만들었다.“음... 우선 행상이 한 분 계셨는데... 아, 마을에 석 달이나 반년마다 들리는 행상 어르신이 한 분 있었습니다. 연세에 비하여 무척 정력적이고 성격이 호방하여 활력 또한 넘치는 분이셨습니다. 저는 그분이 마을에 찾아오실 때마다 우선으로 달려가 모시고 형편 맞는 대로 탁주라도 한 사발씩 대접한 까닭에 사이가 가까워질 수 있었습니다. 물론 저 나름도 꿍꿍이가 있어 아내에게 사 줄 물건이 있거든 좀 미리 보기도 하고 싸게 사보려는 의도도 있었던 건 사실입니다. 아무튼 그런 사심을 빼놓고 봐도 친하게 지내고 싶을 만큼 배울 점도 많고 행상을 다니며 쌓으신 견문 또한 넓어, 같이 마주 앉아 이야기를 듣는 재미가 있는 그런 어르신이었습니다. 나잘에 대하여서도 그분께 들었습니다. 그러나 저에게는 조금은 허황되고 이질적인 이야기였으므로, 무엇보다 먹고 사는데 보탬이 될 얘기도 아니기에 크게 마음에 두지 않았습니다. 물론 제가 더 바랄 것 없이 행복했던 까닭에 그랬을 수도 있지요. 그리고 나잘의 이야기며, 여러 이야기들은 어르신에게서 저로, 저에게서 아내로 전달되었습니다. 저에겐 크게 탐탁찮은 얘기였지만 아내는 이런 이야기를 좋아했죠. 제가 그 어르신께 들은 얘기를 연거푸 몇 번을 들려주어도 질리지 않았습니다. 그래서 또 그 이야깃거리를 얻으려고 행상 어르신이 오실 때마다 더 살갑게 붙어 지냈죠. 그리고 한번은 BB에서 이름이 난 장인이 만든 비녀라며 세상에 하나 밖에 없다는 귀한 비녀를 구해다 주셨습니다. 형편에 맞는 물건이 아니었지만 꽤 비싼 값을 치르고 아내에게 선물했죠. 아내는 그걸 보물처럼 생각했습니다.아마 일 년 전 꼭 이맘때였을 겁니다. 행상 어르신이 마을에 봇짐을 잔뜩 짊어진 여러 무리를 끌고 오셨습니다. 그들을 자신과 늘 A(AA, BB가 속한 지역 이름 생각해서 다시 적기)로 함께 교역 가는 무리라 소개하시고는 한다는 말씀이 어르신이 몸이 예전 같지 않아 그 먼 길을 가기가 힘들다고 하셨죠. 그리고는 저는 힘도 세고 체력도 좋으니 자기 대신 교역에 따라가 보는 게 어떠냐고 하셨습니다. 종자돈도 얼마간 빌려주고 어르신이 아시는 A국 장사치들도 소개시켜준다면서요. 이문이 많이 남는 장사니 시간은 좀 걸리고 몸은 고되도 그 값을 충분히 한다는 말씀에 귀가 솔깃했습니다. 떳떳한 장사였는지는 모르겠지만요... 어찌 되었든 그간 어르신에게 쏟은 정성을 다 보답 받는 기분이기도 했습니다. 조그만 고향마을에서 벌어봐야 하루 세끼 먹기도 힘든 팔자인데 잘하면 아내를 호강 시켜줄 수도 있다는 생각 때문에요. 물론 아내와 몇 달이고 떨어져 있어야 한다는 사실이 맘에 걸리긴 했지만 아내를 배불리 먹이지 못한다는 죄책감을 덜 생각에 이를 악물고 참았습니다. 결국 그 당일에 아내도 설득했고 저는 즉시 아내더러 친정에 가 있으라 했습니다. 그 이튿날 어르신이 써 주신 서신과 빌린 돈을 품에 잘 간직하고, 짐 보따리를 이고 급하게 교역을 떠나게 됐지요.그렇게 두어 달을 길 위에서 보내고 AA에 도착하니 사람 많은 게 참 별세계였습니다. 물정 모르는 제가 어찌할 바를 모르니 함께 교역 온 사람들이 도움을 주어 어르신이 아시는 상인들도 만나 물건도 팔고 사고하였습니다. 뭐 제가 한 건 크게 없지만요. 아무튼 물건 값을 제대로 모르니 이문이 남는지 어떤지도 알지 못한 탓에 큰돈을 번 기쁨 같은 게 있을 리야 없었고 우선은 집에 돌아가고 싶은 맘 뿐이었습니다.교역을 다 마치고 집으로 돌아오는 내내 일행을 재촉한 덕분에 예정보다 빨리 고향에 돌아올 수 있었습니다. 아니, 그 덕에 더 빨리 알아버렸지요. 아내가 죽었다는, 정확히는 자결했다는 얘기를요. 아무도 이유를 모르더군요. 아내는 죽기 전날에 왜인지 한밤중에 친정을 나와서 우리 집으로 갔고 그 다음날 죽은 걸 처남이 발견했다고 했습니다.”“아니, 대관절 무슨 일이 있었길래...”“진상을 아는 사람이 없습니다. 그러게 말입니다. 대체 무슨 일로...”이미 날이 어둑해져 볼 수는 없었지만 오의 또렷한 눈은 틀림없이 충혈돼 있을 터였다. 더 묻고 싶었으나 피차 지친 탓에 다음을 기약하기로 하였다.그 다음날부터 몸에 열이 나기 시작했다. 팔다리가 끊어지게 아파서 운신을 할 수가 없었다. 몸에 못된 벌레가 들어가서 뼈마디를 갉아 먹는 것만 같았다. 눈을 질끈 감고 일어나지를 못하니 오는 여러 번 나를 부르다가 어찌할 바 몰라 안절부절못했다. 너무나 춥다는 나의 말에 오는 보자기며, 여분의 옷이며 등을 모아 나를 돌돌 말아 업었다. 살았다가 또 죽다가 참 하루를 사이에 두고 운명이 널뛰기를 해대니 사람으로서 버티기가 어렵다. 오는 또 그렇게 나를 업고서 걷기 시작했다.그렇게 보면 단지 전날의 깨끗한 정신은 회광반조에 지나지 않았는가 싶고, 나는 잠시 고개를 돌렸던 죽음이 또다시 나를 향해 눈을 부라리는 오싹한 장면을 싫어도 마주할 수밖에 없었다. 이 지겨운 대면은 며칠을 이어졌다. 그리고 오의 걸음걸이는 눈에 띄게 느려지고 있었다. 죽음을 피해갈 수 없는 예감이 들었다. 오에게 미안했다. 미안한 마음이 너무 커져 몸과 마음이 함께 괴로웠다. 그래서 오에게 말했다.“나는 천신님이 주책없는 늙은이를 위해 삶의 마지막에 나잘을 보여 주시려고 자네를 보내주었는가 생각도 하네.”“그런 말씀 마십시오. 괜찮아 지실 겁니다...”“자네 같은 사람은 이제껏 본 일이 없는데... 사람인가, 나잘인가, 극락은 또 무엇이고, 사람이 주리면 짐승처럼 감춘 이빨을 꺼내 물고 잔악하게 굴기도 하는 게 자연의 이치인데, 자네는 이 가운데 송장보다 나을 게 없는 사람을 보살피니 나는 참말 이런 사람은 이제껏 본 일이 없다.”그냥 나오는 데로 지껄여 말을 마치고 나니 오는 한참 또 말이 없다.깜빡 잠이 들었다가 깨었나 보다. 귀에 멍하게 울리는 소리에 골이 아파 깨니, 오는 그 튼실하던ㅡ그러나 지금은 또 빼쭉 말라 버린ㅡ 어깨를 들썩이며 우는 게 느껴진다. 정신이 멀쩡히 처신하였던 들 이런 상황이 갑자기 벌어진 까닭을 짐작할 수 없는 노릇이다. 잠잠히 멀어가는 의식을 이를 악물며 붙들어 매고 잠시 기다리니 내 몽롱한 의식을 대번에 관통하는 단연한ㅡ이 한단어로 표현 못 할 단호한ㅡ 말소리가 들리기 시작했다.<a data-href="200414 - 나잘 가는 길2_미완" href="https://64etuor.github.io/writings/novels/200414-나잘-가는-길2_미완.html#_0" class="internal-link"

꾀꼬리]]></title><description><![CDATA[동창의 소개로 알게 된 이 여성은 자기를 은하라 했다. 여대를 나왔다지만 은근히 남자를 모르는 눈치는 아녔고, 첫 만남에 달리 서먹함 없이 붙임성 좋게 대구 말을 거는 게 사람 사귐에 벽이 없는 듯하였다. 차 한 잔 나오기도 전에 자꾸 말에 붙들려 다니다가 내가 대답을 시원스레 한 번 못하니까 [이런 자린 처음이신가 봐요.] 라고 하면서도 그 말의 직후로도 마구 휘둘러대는 것이 영 생초짜에 대한 배려가 없다. 그러나 나도 딱 사람을 보게 된 바로부터 맘이 흔들리는 게 그런 것도 아랑곳 않고 휘둘림이 즐겁다. 이리 저리 끌려 다니는 게 즐겁다.나오고 나서야 지레 겁을 먹고 동창에게 끝까지 함께 해줄 것을 못 박은 것이 얼마나 어리석은 행동이었는지 깨닫는다. 그러나 나중으로 보면 무슨 얘기를 하는지는 기억조차 안 나고 심지어 당시에도 온통 가늠이 없던 게, 왜 사람은 한번 분위기에 휩쓸리고 나면 그것이 순항인지, 풍랑인지 분간을 못하는지 짜장 영문을 모른다. 처음에나 또 어느 순간에는 얘기가 제법 되어가는 듯 하다가도 불현 서로 한숨씩 돌리게 되면 반드시 불안이 휩싼다. 나는 더듬거리는 게 어색한 티를 미처 못 벗고도 무슨 얘기든 꺼내려 용을 쓰는데 그 말의 대부분은 오뉴월에 서리가 내리도록 안배를 한다. 그래도 딴에는 준비하자고 들여다본 책이 몇 권되거늘, 과연 이론과 실전의 차이가 하늘의 이치로 정해졌다는 것만 통감한다. 그쯤 되니 슬슬 내 맘에도 그늘이 져서 이 사람이 날 지루하게 여길까 슬금슬금 눈치만 보게 되고 괜히 컵 하나 들었다 놓는 시늉에도 홱 겁이 끼치며 여인의 시선이 나를 겨냥할 때는 모조리 무섭다. 이 와중에 동창의 재치로 일시 밖으로 불려나오니 숨통을 그저 놓았다.다짜고짜 [왜 이리 재주가 없냐.] 질타하는 것을 평소 같으면 배알이 꼴려 화도 좀 내보련만 속이 아주 애가 타서 나의 고개가 밑이 빠져 떨어진다. 깝깝하게 담배를 태우는 동창에 괜히 미안한 맘이 든다. 자신은 없지만 속에 다시 꼿꼿한 마음을 업어 메고 생각하길 [필시 이대로 물러선다면 앞으로 세상에 남자로 행세할 길 막막하다.]마음을 무장하고선 재차 들어온 까페는 첫인상의 상쾌함과 다르게 난세의 전쟁터다. 으슬으슬 살이 떨리는 게 밤도 아니 오고 추위가 먼저 왔거나, 냉방에 넉넉한 인심 쓰길 좋아하는 주인의 맘씨 탓일 것이다. 은하 씨는 전화기를 만지작거리고 있는데 눈 안에 그 모습이 들어오니 또 입술이 바짝 마르고 서리가 어리는 게 입을 열기만 하면 곧바로 찢어질 성 싶다. 그래도 여인의 마음씨가 참으로 비단결 같아 이쪽을 보며 웃어주니 괜히 훈훈하게 맘에 덥힌 술이라도 붓는 것 같고 그 옆에 가면 한결 온기가 난다.다시금 여인의 맞은편에 앉아 속으로 [봄이여 오라.]고 외치고 나니 머리에선 내 애초의 다짐, 청춘의 막바지 한구석에 어떻게든 연애 한 번이라도 꾸겨 넣고자 결심했던 그 다짐을 되새김질이다.허나 작심이 삼일을 못 가고 흐지부지하는 것이 일반인 것과 내 경우의 것은 유통기한의 길고 짧음이 자못 다르다. 내가 여즉 남들의 전장으로만 알았던 연애전선에 용사의 자격을 얻고자 참전했음에, 스스로 대견하게 여긴 보잘 것 없는 자신감은 3초 만에 세상모르고 행방이 없다. 분명코 악의가 없는 평범한 말인데도 이리로 찔리고 저리로 찔리는 것이 바람구멍 숭숭 난 벌집처럼 되가는 통에 정신을 되찾을 길 아예 없다. 총성이 울리는 것도 같고 어디서 포를 쏴대는 것도 같은데 여인은 맘 편히 웃으며 얘기하는 게 어쩐지 나 혼자만 죽을 맛이다.이것은 억울하다. 그깟 연애 못 해봤다고 죽으라는 법도 없는데 이러다간 진심으로 속이 타 죽을 지경이다. 그러고 보니 나는 왜 굳이 이 나이가 되어서 생전 없던 용기를 짜냈는지 괜히 스스로 성이 난다. 속없이 웃자니 저가 못나 보이고 그렇다고 우울해하자니 마땅한 핑계가 없다. 따지고 보면 내가 기어이 조르고 졸라 마련한 자리도 아녔다. 준비했던 시험에 합격한 후에 겹경사로 친구가 여자를 소개시켜준다고 하였는데 그전 같음 기어코 사양할 것을 그제야 맘에 조금은 여유가 생겼던 것이다. 허나 여자와의 인연 하나 없이 졸업을 맞게 생긴 청춘을 자력으로 거부할 능력이 없었다. 여자를 만나는 생각만 해도 벌써 겁이 덜컥덜컥 나고 할 일은 먼 산 중턱에 걸렸다. 그래서 맘 한쪽은 동해도 한사코 사양한 것을 하루고 닷새고 붙들며 나를 설득하는 소리가 [인생의 반은 여자로 채워지는데 그것을 모르면 너는 인생을 모른다.]든가 [기껏 공부해놓고 인생을 조금도 즐기지 못하면 무슨 소용이냐.]든가 하는 것이다. 그래도 내 표정이 굳으니깐 나중에는 조심스레 내 변변찮은 자존심까지 슬금슬금 건들면서 [남자의 도리]내지는 [인생의 기회]따위를 역설하는 게 아닌가. 그럼 나도 체면이 더 이상 거절할 수 없었다. [그럼 자리를 한 번 마련해다오.]하고 즉시 맘엔 걱정과 우려만 앞섰던 것이다. 그러므로 이 자리에 내가 누를 끼치는 책임의 오 분 지일쯤은 친구의 몫이다.ㅡ라며 자위하는데 이게 또 지금 보면 그럴 도리가 아니다. 친구는 기꺼이 조연이 되어 이따금 대화를 거들어 주는데 첫무대인 주연은 대사치는 형색을 영 형편없이 굴었다. 거기에 남탓을 할 텐가.이 사람들은 대화하는 경지가 마치 하늘에 닿았다. 둘이서 그 보통을 갑절쯤 웃도는 솜씨로 자웅을 겨루고 있으면 나는 온종일 벙어리가 되어도 되려 안심이 된다. 그러다 내게 차례가 돌아와 두개 시선이 갑자기 내 얼굴에 박히면 난 무덤 파는 흉내라도 내야할 것만 같다. 처음과 얼굴이 천지로 다른 시계소리는 어째 심장박동과 반비례로 느려진다. 몸이 밀랍 초처럼 허물어지는데 불이 핀 기척은 없다. 나는 왜 이렇게 초라한 건지?그렇게 악몽이 2시간이다. 등줄기에 식는 땀은 얼어붙을 지경으로 추위는 더러 가시는 법도 없이 변치 않고 얼음장이다. 시곗바늘이 뉘엿뉘엿 기어가서 숫자 6을 꿰뚫는 동시로 나는 도망칠 궁리가 바쁘다. 친구를 알게 모르게 채근해서 기어이 핑계를 대도록 만든다. [은하야, 오늘 우리 과 졸업한 선배랑 술 한잔하기로 해서..]라는 뻔한 거짓말도 좋다. 물론 여인께 벼락 맞을 놈이 된다는 우려는 자글대며 내 속을 태우지만, 그래도 양심에 비롯한 가책쯤 받는다고 사람이 목이 졸려 숨지는 사태란 없다. 옳다. 이건 나쁜 일이 아니다. 사람은 우선 저가 살아야 남도 챙길 수가 있는 법이다.그러나 이렇게 해방될 기미가 눈앞에 가물거리니 나는 까닭 없이 맘이 슬프다. 연신 웃어주던 은하 씨의 앞에 죄인인 양 몸과 마음이 괴롭다. 슬프다. 그러나 또 할 수 없다. 줄기차게 맘엔 짐이 쌓이고 법석을 떠는 자책이 머릿속 가득이다. 저한테 거북해지는 걸 무릅쓰고 결정한 일이다. 이제 단호하게 여인이 갈 길로 가도록 보내줘야 하고 그녀도 별 말 없이 가게 될 것이다ㅡ그런데 간다? 아니, 이대로 영영 가는 것만은 안 된다. 나는 그런 생각을 하니 머리를 호되게 얻어맞은 듯 정신이 바짝 난다. 여기서 반드시 담에 만날 구실을 만들어 놓지 않으면 또 혼자 남아 떠내려가다 잡을 지푸라기고 동아줄이고 절대로 오리무중이다. 그러므로 나는 나고 난 후 한시같이 가뭄인 용기를 억지로 쥐어짜서 묻는다. [저에게 연락처를 가르쳐주신다면 폐가 되겠습니까?]라는 말을 엿가락처럼 늘려 말하고 나니 무슨 뜻인지 기실 가닥이 없다. 그러나 그 여인은 내 기가 아주 막히게 영리한 고로 개떡같이 말한 것을 찰떡같이 알아듣고 흔쾌히 자신의 전화번호를 알려준다. 나는 꼭 금방 전화하겠다는 말을 하였고 대답도 시원하다. [안녕히 가세요.]라며 내 고개가 숙여지는 건 연장자께 대한 예우보다 고개가 30도는 더 꺾여 내려갔다. 여인은 행동에 지리한 부연 없이 더없이 깔끔하다. 저리로 가고 있다.가고 있다.아직 가고 있다.아, 이제야 보이지가 않는다.한결 숨쉬기가 수월해지니 갈증이 나서 친구를 보챈다. 물이 고픈 갈증 아니라 술이 고픈 갈증이다.신입생 시절 친구와 출근하듯 드나들던 술집에 간다. 술부터 시켜놓고 한잔 마시니 벌써 취한 것만 같다. 평소엔 귓등으로도 안 듣던 가요의 가사가 어째 그리 귀에 쏙쏙 빨려 들어가는지 블랙홀이 따로 없고, 사랑이란 단어가 흔하게 튀어나올 때면 가슴이 뜨끔거리고 으슬으슬하며 열이 나는 게 어쩐지 감기에 걸렸다.그 소개받던 자리에서 걸린 말 못하는 병이 여서까지 옮았다. 쭈뼛대고 할 말을 못 찾고 있으니까 동창은 술잔에 술만 디립다 부어대고 나는 또 그걸 곧이 곧대로 받아 마신다. 그러다가 친구는 뜬금없이 너털웃음이다. 수염도 없는 녀석이 제법 턱을 쓰다듬으며 한다는 소리는 [그래도 걔 니가 맘에 드나 보더라. 쉽게 정 주는 애 아닌데.]맘이 우울할 때는 어떤 칭찬도 곧이 들리지를 않는 법인데 어째 이 말은 그리도 내 마음을 울리는지! 희망을 주는 친구의 선의의 거짓말이든, 실로 그런 눈치가 있었든, 가리지 않고 나는 가슴이 운다. 여느 때와 마찬가지라면 의연한 척 농담으로 받아쳤을 거를 나는 돌연 눈이 뜨이고 심장은 작정하고 터질듯이 요동을 쳐서 수줍은 색시다. 불은 가슴팍을 알뜰히 불사를 기세로 타오르고 그 불이 마침내 얼굴까지 뻗쳐서 입을 열면 용이 되는 마술을 부린다. 친구는 수나롭게 술병을 또 갖다 대는데 나는 마침 내일이 없다. 1차로, 2차로, 3차로 술잔치를 거나하게 치르고 나니 꼴이 본업은 초라하게 마치고 잔짓거리에 온통 애를 쓴 바와 진배없다. 허나 그렇게 마시고도 정신만은 또렷한 건 곰곰히 생각하지 않아도 분명 뜻이 이렇다. 비록 남의 몸을 빌린 것마냥 비척대지만 최소한 집으로 와 이불에 누워 앞으로의 행복한 상상을 해 볼 여지만은 남겨둔 것이다. 아직 처음본 사이로 어떠한 장래도 약속한 바 없지만 그래도 사람 마음은 또 그게 아니다. 열 평 남짓한 방 안에 이불을 난장으로 펴고 누우니 애쓰지 않아도 절로 그런 생각이 나는게 아닌가.망상은 꽃다지로 굼실굼실 피어나고 매일 같이 물레방아 돌던 인생사의 고민은 스스로 해탈을 했다. 여인은 꽃단장으로, 불이란 티끌도 없는 어둔 방안을 실로 실로 나풀거리고, 나는 배에 올라 허공엘 뜬 듯이 싱그러운 바람을 탄다. 별이 총총히 들은 하늘, 은하수에 실려 가면 꼭 이런 기분만 같을 테다. 술의 기운 또한 나의 기분을 한껏 돋우고 밤은 깊어지고 나도 그대로 눈을 깊게 감는다.눈을 뜨면 항상 꼭 우선으로 찾던 담배도 잊고 전화기부터 만지작거린다. 어제 무슨 술을 잘못 먹고 미화가 된 겐지 전화하는 법을 모른다.'이쯤은 한창 씻고 아침 준비하기로 바쁜 시간이니 좀 더 미루자.''휴식을 취할 시간인데 괜히 전화하지 말자.''초면일 뿐인데 다짜고짜 전화하는 건 실례가 될 테다.''식사 중이실 거다.' '하루가 바빠 일찍 잠에 들었을지 모른다.'여인의 곱고 하얀 얼굴이 눈에 선하다. 그러나 하루가 꼬박 다가도록 나는 전화를 못했으니 낯에 표정 없이 우울해 진다. 종일 봉산탈춤이 아니라 병신탈춤을 췄다 하더라도 보람이 이보다 됫박은 더 찼을 것이다. 나는 용기가 없는 저자신이 양껏 우스워져서 소주 한 병을 꺼내온다.{십여 번을 울려본 전화벨 너머로 들려오는 것은 녹음된 목소리뿐이다. 그러니까 이틀 전, 금새로 전화하길 꼭 다짐을 받았던 지라 못해도 그 약조가 삼일은 가지 않을까 생각했던 터에 은근히 속이 쌔리다.불시에 우울해지는 것엔 통 대책이 없다. 무슨 연유가 있어 전화받는 잠시의 시간조차 할애하지 못하는 것인지 아니면 무어에 정신이 홀려 전혀 다른 일에 열중을 한 것인지... 성실하게 생각이 망상으로 잦아들어감에도 불구하고 시간은 늦는 대로 저대로 또 늦장이다.분명 예전과 판이하게 달라진 오늘날에 저마다 앞다투어 마련한 게 전화기다. 미련하게 골방에 갇혀 전화기만 쳐다보고 있는 것도 아니라 안으로 밖으로 저 할일을 해가며 인연의 연락을 팔자 좋게 기다릴 수도 있는 것이다. 그러므로 즉, 내 생각이지만 나와 인연이 될 줄로 믿었던 은하 씨의 부재, 혹은 이 돌아오지 않는 벨소리는 그대로 영원의 허공 속으로 사라져 닿지도 않는 메아리가 될 수도 있다는 사실. 그 사실은 모처럼의 휴일에 맞이하기에는 너무나도 잔인한 사실이었다.}친구에게 구호와 조언을 요청한 것은 내가 일궈낸 일중 몇 안 되는 대견한 일이다. 전화를 받고 내 말이며 말투에 힘이 쪽 빠졌으니까 이 친구는 짐작으로 나를 알고 급히 불렀다.사람 구실 힘든 병신 하나, 돼지고기님, 소주 한 분을 청중으로 모시고 시작된 이 나의 친구분의 강연엔 실로 탄복하고 말았는데, 여자의 심리란 얼마나 거대하고 오묘한 것이며 논리의 허점을 싸그리 들추고 마는지! 이것을 학문으로 치면 더 어렵고 복잡한 과목이란 없다.더러 논리로 설명할 수 있으나 그럴 수 없기도 한 것. 이성과 감정 사이를 쉴 새 없이 오고 가므로 그것을 알아차리기 위해선 숙련된 눈치가 필요하다는 것. 그 어떤 재주가 뛰어난 사람도 여자를 명쾌하게 설명할 수 없다는 것. 겉과 속이 극명하게 다를 수도 있다는 것. 집중하여 듣기를 구태여 요약하자면 이와 같은 얘기였다.그렇게 공맹으로도 알지 못하던 세상의 진리를 배우고 되새기니 나는 동서와 고금을 막론하고 삶의 으뜸으로 치던 음양의 조화를 새삼 깨닫는다. 친구는 여전히 갈증이 나도록 대차게 일장연설이다. 나는 이같이 즐거운 공부가 없다.밤이 깊어 가는데 나는 가로등 불빛이 음산하게 깔린 길을 걷는다. 아직 전화가 없다. 필시 부재중에 전화가 온 것을 확인했을 터, 허면 반드시 이렇다 저렇다 답이 있을 진데 그것이 없다. 조급한 맘은 다소 가라앉았으나 역시 들어봐야겠다. 생각 없이 버튼을 눌렀다.벨렐레 소리가 가는데 심장이 난리다. 이 전화를 안 받아도 문제, 받아도 문제. 그러나 내가 이걸 그대로 끊어야 할 지 마음을 미처 정하기 전에, [여보세요.] 난 입이 얼었다. 생각해보니 무슨 말을 할 지 계획하지 않고 전화를 건 게 실수다. 내가 간신히 이름을 꺼내고 나니 여인은 그대로 또 웃음이다. 넙죽넙죽 대답만 하다가 서로 말없으면 나는 눈물이 쏙 빠질 지경이다. 늦은 밤 전화한 것을 사과했고, 그날 바쁘게 도망간 걸 사과했고, 말 없는 걸 사과했으니 나는 인제 이상으로 연설 끝이다. 머리에는 지나가는 낱말도 하나 없어 여자가 말을 꺼내기만 기다린다. 한동안 침묵이고 여자는 피곤해서 그만 자야겠단다. 다음에 통화하자는 말에 눈만 껌벅이다가 대꾸만 얼른하고 난 마음이 싸리하다.멀리 가로수 가지가 바람에 떨리는데 위로는 우중충한 구름이 깔려, 가로등 빛으로 퍼져가는 한줄기 파동을 잡아먹고도 배가 고파 굼뜬 양으로 느적느적한다. 비추지 않는 달을 슬쩍 사유해보니, 저기 떠있는 그게 보이는 때와 보이지 않는 때는 구름의 존재 여부가 중요한 게 아니다. 구름의 출생 진원을 마음에 두면은 나는 달이 보이지를 않는다. 보이지 않는 달이 멀고 집이 멀고 밤은 까맣다.나이와 역사는 하루하루 더해지는데 이상하게도 전화할 핑계는 생산이 없다. 말이 담으로 전화하잔 말이지, 뜻이 다른 걸 모를 정도로 어수룩하지는 않다. 말로 학비요, 술값을 벌어 썼던 잔머리는 고장이고 속도 텁텁하니 막혀서 병도 안 나고 몸뚱이가 천근만근으로 힘겹다. 더 이상 친구 앞에 못난 꼴 보이는 것도 구색이 영 좋지 않다. 나는 이것이 홀로 견뎌야할 고난임을 직감했다.황금 같은 일요일에 자리에 누워 따로 할 일 없다. 지구는 과연 자전과 공전을 하는 게 사실으로 요지경마냥 돌아가고 천지는 셀 수없이 뒤바뀐다. 중력은 끝없이 나를 잡아당겨 어디로 가는지를 모르고 베개를 벤 머리와 다리의 높낮이가 수시로 반전이다. 아른거리는 것은 얼굴도 없고 안개에 가렸다. 아니, 안개는 내 눈에 찬 모양으로 눈앞이 차분히 소리도 안 나고 젖어가는 게 곤경과 재난 없이도 세상이 운다.어지러움. 인생의 어떤 경향에 대하여 백 번 천 번 소란으로 일관하는 세상의 태도ㅡ라는 생각였지만 이제 보니 나 홀로 어지러운 것이다. 세상에 홀로 있는 듯이 쭈욱 혼자로 지내온 시간에 책임은 스스로의 몫였다. 그러므로 지금 내가 취해야 할 태도는 합리적인, 그리고 이성적인 판단이다.지지리 못난이를 그만한 여인이 맘에 차할 까닭 없다. 그러므로 묘한 수가 없는 한 연락할 구실을 만들어봐야 역효과만 날 뿐이다. 뚜껑을 열어봐야 아는 것이 사람 일이라지만 결착이 뻔한 상황에 억지환상으로 내 맘을 속이면 그건 안 될 일이다. 그럼 강구할 수단은 무언가. 입때로 여자를 모르던 내가 갑자기 뾰족한 수를 내어 일에 해결을 볼 요량은 없다. 그럼 낯짝을 두둑히 덧대 얹고 끈질기게 친구에게 구원을 요청하든가, 아니면 (가망 없지만)이 머저리가 여인의 맘에 조속히 잠입할 수 있도록 진곡하게 빌어보든가, 그도 아니면 일찍이 포기하는 수 밖에는.그렇게 내가 이성의 호감을 얻는 분야의 일에서 완전히 무력하다는 사실을 곱씹다가 오래전 친구와의 대화가 떠올랐다. 친구는 그놈의 술을 함께 마시다가 별안간 지나는 말로 [내 여동생이 네 얘기를 하면 참 재밌어하더라.] 라고 했다. 그때 흘려듣는 척 술잔 비우며 그러나 속으로, 나도 재미난 구석이 있단 말에 얼마나 안심이 된 줄 모른다. 그러나 생각을 골똘히 해보면 그 재미란, 남과 같지 않고 특이한, 이상한 사람을 본, 동물원 관람 수준 이상이 될 리 없는 것이다. 이렇게 무미건조한 무말랭이같은 인간이 되 버린 건 삶이 정말로 무미건조했던 것을 전적으로 원인 삼는다. 확실히 인생사에 사건, 사고가 끊이질 않아야 사람 사는 맛도 나고 멋도 날 구색이 맞는다. 그럼 궁리의 끝엔 늘 제 능력의 빈곤함만 남는다. 나는 괜한 생각을 꺼낸 기분이 든다.불현 든 의문인데, [이것이 사랑인가]라는. 그럼 난 여인에 첫눈에 반해 이토록 애가 타고 열병이 난건가 따지고 들면 사랑 자체가 또 알쏭달쏭이다. 변명할 여지는 없다만, 그래도 내가 처음으로 겪는 이와 같은 애틋한 감정을 구태여 뭔가 다른 이름으로 부르고 싶은 기분이다. 그러니까 사랑이 아닐지도 모른다. 첫눈에 반한다는 건 사실 있기 어려운 일 일테니. 내 모자란 경험의 반증으로 힘들어 하는 것뿐, 진실로 사랑인 것을 내가 모를 뿐이다.ㅡ하며 나는 마침내 도망치고 있다. 여기서 더는 추해질 구석이 없을 만치로 몸도 마음도 모두다 폐허다. 그러나 길 잃은 마음이 어디로 피난을 갈는지. 이루어지기 힘든 가엾은 사랑은 뉘라서 알아주며 나의 열과 성은 무엇으로 보답받는지. 그런데 또 맘은 달라 불과 하루 새에 이룩된 사랑이지만 이보다 귀한 것이 없다. 사랑은 천하만물 중의 제일 가는 보배로만 이루어진, 그러나 죄 없이도 죄인을 만드는 게 사랑이다. 그리고 내게 죄가 쌓이는 것은 사랑을 넘본 탓이다. 나는 안 된다. 마침내 기운이 탈진한 기색만 역력한 말투로 [나는 안된다.] 뇌까리고 나니 세상이 없다. 갑자기 깜깜한 어둠만 남아 몸에는 야행의 벌레만 기어 다니고 내 발뒤꿈치는 딛는 데가 없다. 열 평 남짓한 골방에조차 내 자리는 하나도 없다.내 몸은 망망대해에 부유한 섬이 되어 가슴 언저리에 야자나무가 뿌리 내리고 눈꺼풀 위로 얼굴 시커먼 갈매기 한 쌍 앉았다. 그건 어디서 껌댕을 묻혀 온 거다. 연이어 얼굴을 부비는 풍경이 갸륵하나 또 밉살궂기도 하다. 그래 껌댕을 나눠 갖고서 다시 어디로 나는지 모른다. 한 쌍이 하나의 점으로 될 때 얄팍하고 가벼운 부초는 바다 위에 떴다. 끝물의 햇살이 깔리는 지평선을 배경으로 파도를 맞는 외로운 섬. 비장한 음색에 젖은 바위는 저녁 밀물에 시나브로 잠겨가고 방황하는 심장은 상실의 무게를 안은 채로 심해 깊숙이 침전한다. 누군가 바다가 해를 통째로 집어 삼키는 걸 숨 막히게 지켜본다. [까악까악.] 뜬금없이 어디선가 까마귀는 운다. [까악까악.]왠 까마귀람.그러나 아무래도 괜찮다. 심상이 잠들어가는 사이는 양수가 보살피는 은혜와 같다. 더없이 아늑한 요람 속에서. 잠에 들어서는.다음날 내가 얼마나 처참하게 부서졌는지 구경 온 친구는 내 꼴을 보곤 기겁을 하고 나를 들쳐 업었다. 내 땀인지 친구가 흘린 땀인지 모르겠다만 업힌 등짝이 야무지게 축축한 게 여간 거슬리는 게 아니다. 밤사이 아팠는지 어땠는지 어림짐작도 없다가 금새 수긍한다. 아팠다. 아픈 건 몸이 먼전지 마음이 먼전지 모른다. 아무튼 아팠다. 아파서 눈물이 나는 게 아니라 다만 몸에 수분이 넘친다. 간밤엔 비가 온 모양인지 거리는 눅눅한 도화지처럼 알록달록 퍼져 버렸다.간밤에 어렴풋이 친구의 전화를 받은 기억이 있다. 무슨 말을 했는지는 부지불식으로 가뭇하다. 그리고 지금은 의사가 묻는 말에 정신이 없다. 골이 지끈지끈하니 생각도 수월치 않다.골방에만 지내오다가 병원 침대에서 호강을 하니 조금 춥긴 해도 감지덕지다. 몸살이랬다. 그런 흔한 병으로 불리는 건 내키지 않는 일이지만 할 수 없다. 아무리 재주 좋은 의사라 해도 사람 몸을 들여다볼 수나 있는 거지 마음을 열어볼 순 없는 일이니까. 편한 마음먹기로 한다. 그런데 예정에 없던 이 휴식을 만끽하려는 찰나에 친구의 질문은 나의 골통, 여덟 치 남짓한 우주를 온통 깨뜨려 놓는다.[그렇게 좋으냐.]이 말 한마디는 날 괜히 병신으로 만들어서 양파도 안 까고 눈물이 질질 쏟아지는 거다. 그런데 내 하는 꼴을 보고 둘도 없는 친구라는 게 뭔 허울이 그리 좋다고 연방 실웃음 인지, 기가 막히고 코가 막히나 분을 낼 기운이 없다. 한참을 그렇게 궁상인데 친구는 뭐라고 중얼대나 싶더니 묘한 미소가 만연하다. 사내를 포기하는 길에 여력을 다 쓰니 의식이 멀다.눈을 뜨니 옆엔 친구가 있다. 솔직하고 큰 허물이 되는 말이지만 친구가 아니라 은하 씨가 있음 좋았을 걸 하는 망상을 했다. 혼자 앓아봐야 소용이 안 된다. 습관처럼 휴대폰을 열어보는데 흔한 광고 문자조차 없다. 영양제를 다 맞고 나면 미련 없이 손 털고 일어나면 된다. 그담엔 무엇이 있느냐하면 지옥을 전세로 놓은 열 평 남짓한 방구석이 있다. 외로움이 휘감아오는 월요일의 저녁 어스름이다. 친구와 병원 밖으로 나서는데 몽롱하니 아직 꿈속에 있다.꿈을 얘기하자면, 그러니까 오래전부터 간직해온 나의 꿈을 얘기하자면 그저 평범한 가정을 일구어 오손도손 살림하면 그만인 시시한 얘기다. 염치없이 최근에 은하 씨를 거기에 편입시킨 것은 절대로 불손한 일이지마는 어차피 나만 아는 꿈일 뿐으로, 것도 의도한 바가 아니라 무의식간에 벌어진 헛짓거리다.함께 손을 잡고 우린 왠 잔치를 보러 갔다. 거기에 집안 식구들 모두 모여 신명이 나게 춤도 추고 멋드러지게 한 곡 뽑기도 하고 아무튼 즐거움 외로는 씨알도 없다. 은하 씨는 한복을 곱게 입은 게 선녀가 땅에 왔고 그 옆의 나는 재주도 없이 연방 난리굿이다. 웃는 소리는 그치지 않고 흐르며 아우성이고, 까치 한 쌍 마당에 복작대는 건 아무래도 할 말이 많은 모양이다. 온갖 나무의 가지가 머리 숙여 인사하고 벚꽃잎은 사방으로 흐드러진 곳, 행복은 거기다 두고 왔다. 흐리멍덩한 의식 간에 붙잡고 있는 기억 오직 그 뿐이다.날 쉬이 내 방으로 돌리지 않고 어떻게든 뭔가 먹이려는 친구의 노력이 가상하다. 그러나 지금의 나는 마음에 한 치 공간도 남에게 허락지 않으려는 편협함에 코를 꿰여, 가상한 친구의 노력도 가상하게 와 닿질 않는다. 오지랖이 넓고 늘어져 바닥에 질질 끌고 다니는 것도 아닐 텐데 친구는 왜 이따위 종자에게 공을 들이는지 영문을 모른다.갑자기 춤이라도 추고 싶은 게 꼭 술에 취해서 세상이 내 것만 같았던, 아니 지금으로 말하자면 역설적으로 세상에 내 것이 하나 없어서 분에 겨운 춤을 추고 싶은 기분이다. 아직도 오락가락인 심사는 내 벗의 손을 벗어나도록 까탈 부리는 정성이 지극한데, 여느 때와 달리 급작스레 변심하고 포기라는 단어를 사전에서 지워버린 친구, 너는 하지만 오늘 하루 애쓴 것은 영 글렀다. 네 대신 은하 씨를 불러주었다면. 그렇다. 너는 나를 위한 정을 쏟기보다 전화 한 통하는 편이 옳았다. 분으로 찬 눈은 또한 피로 찼다. 그 피는 널 쳐다본다. 너, 널? 난 왜 미쳐 가는지?여러 날이 가도록 나의 생사는 남의 손에 들려있으니 목숨이라 봐야 바람 앞의 촛불 신세 이상이 안 된다. 그리고 하는 꼴은 이따금 뱃속에 죽을 쑤셔 넣는 일을 할 때에나 사람 시늉이 좀 되지, 그게 아니면 나는 사람도 아니고 무슨 배고프고 가엾은 짐승과 비등하다.취해서 전화를 했을 거다. 그건 내가 한 일로 생각하기가 싫은 못난 짓거리였다. 내 입이 단단히 미쳐 돌아갔을 것이 빤하다. 이 여성이 내게 정이 떨어졌겠다 생각하면 이제는 아무 일도 안 된다. 하루하루를 힘겹게 배설하며 난 끝장이 난 것만 같은 인생을 돌아보고 있다.창문 밖으로 거닐던 사람들은 소나기가 오니까 사납게 움직이기 시작한다. 갑자기 비를 맞고픈 흥미가 돈다. 신발장의 우산을 쥐지 않고 밖으로 나가니 비가 복슬복슬 앙증맞게 내리고 있다. 이 비를 여과 없이 맞더라도 감기를 피할 예상이 된다. 팔을 제법 휘저으며 걷는다. 생각을 놓는다.밤을 거의 선잠으로 지새우고 아침엔 간만에 집에 전화를 한다. 아버지 목소리를 듣고, 어머니 목소리를 들으니 난 불효한 게 서럽다. 아버지는 어른께 인사드리란 당부를 하고 나머지 말을 저축한다. 나는 차마 사랑한다는 말이 안 나오고 대신 눈물만 그렁그렁 이다.샤워기 찬 물을 세차게 틀고 들어가니 심장이 까무러친다. 먹은 게 없어 야단이 난 뱃속은 식식 김이 빠지고 어제 법석을 떨던 새에 여럿 목숨을 잃은 뇌세포는 정신머리가 차분해진다.냉수 한 잔을 떠다 놓고 삯이고 있다. 친구에게 (아무리 생각일 뿐이지만)흉악스레 분풀이 한 건 끝없이 반성이다. 절제하지 않는 감정을 후회한다. 공허하다. 나락으로 접어든 인생의 감상은 비극다운 과오와 후회로 점철이다. 그러나 과거가 추레한 고삐를 붙들고 내 방향을 사방으로 휘저어 놓아도 살 길은 언제나 앞에 있는 법. 후회를 양식 삼아 앞으로가 풍요로움 고만이다. 내 가슴 협소한 계곡으로 돌아치는 바람이 먼지를 이끌고서 빠져나가는 기척을 뵌다.돌연 전화벨이 울리는데 정신이 빠져 나가 자빠졌다가 돌연 희망이 피어올랐다 또 돌연 낙심이다. 괘씸한 친구 놈의 이름이 반갑지 않다. 전화를 받는 내 목소리는 영락없이 초상이 나서 나머지 모든 상황을 설명한다. 어디어디로 나오라는 친구의 말을 들은 체도 않고 [오늘은 일없다.] 끊고 나서는 내 소심함에 반성이다. 그러나 또 울리는 전화 역시 [일 없대두.] 끊고 나니 나는 단기기억상실환자와 일반으로 같다. 삼일천하도 미처 못 되고 불과 하루 행복했던 일의 대가로는 너무 많은 것을 치렀다. 그것도 쭈욱 오래도록 안녕할 것만 같은 지상지옥의 형편이 보태져서 문제가 심히 난제다. 그나마 안녕이라고 하면 안녕일 것만 같은 인연도, 그 잠깐 손에 스쳐보았던 인연도 내 처지에 다행이라면 다행일 일일테다.새침데기의 모습을 안 취하고도 남의 뺨다구를 실컷 후려갈길 수 있는, 여자는 참으로 복 받은 직업이다. 그리고 족하게 후드려 맞아서 양쪽 볼이 성한 데가 없는 나는 집 밖으로 얼굴을 못 내민다. 그러나 괜찮다. 사람이 사랑에 호되게 데이고 나면 한 뼘 성장할 여력을 만들어 내는 법이다. 그러나 하나 맘에 안 드는 게 있다면, 사람을 한껏 기대로 차게 만든 벨소리의 근원이 전부 내 친구였단 점이다.[삐리리]하는 소리는 반가운 게 하나도 없어서, [삐리리]하고 울면 [까악까악]하는 소리와 마찬가지로 귓구멍을 틀어막는 게 같다. 여즉 기대를 못 버리는 나는 못나져서 한몫의 사람으로는 생각할 수 없고, 날짐승과 한가지로 [까악까악] 우는 나도 [삐리리] 내 속을 뒤집어 놓는데, [까악까악]하는 소리와 [삐리리]하는 소리가 구별 없게 되면 그 틈을 파고들어 서로가 위아래 없이 난장인 거다.이참은 성장할 계제가 된다. 나는 성찰하고 방 안을 바로 잡는데 무슨 못마땅함이 남아서 또 [까악까악]이다. 하릴없이 전화기를 들어본다. 눈앞이 북극이다. 동면하던 심장은 장어 먹은 개구리가 되서 폴딱폴딱 뛰논다.[이은하]단전에서부터 짠 물이 분수로 뿜어지는 걸 억지로 누르고 나는 갈피를 못 잡는다. 받아서 푼수 짓을 반복하느니 안 받는 게 낫겠다는, 그런데 왜 내 선택이란 언제나 내 손 안을 벗어나 있는지 이미 의식 없이 버튼을 눌렀다.[여보세요.]꾀꼬리가 띵가띵가 노니니깐 내 넋은 나가서,[여보세요.]할 수만 있다면 무한히 재생이다.[듣고 계시죠.]네 아무렴요. 그런데 소리가 안 나온다.[저... 저희 오빠가 계속 전화하는데 안 받으셔서요.]그럼요. 누구 전활 기다렸는데.속으로 읊고 나니깐 천국은 불시로 어두운 게, 까마귀는 무슨 놈이 까마귀며, 까마귀의 동생은 무엇이 꾀꼬리며, 꾀꼬리의 오빠는 무슨 놈이 까마귀란 건지?]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/novels/120807-꾀꼬리.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Writings/Novels/120807 - 꾀꼬리.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2024 08:49:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[200414 - 나잘 가는 길2_미완]]></title><description><![CDATA[“어르신을 만나기 전에, 와령에 오기 전에, 사람을 죽였습니다. 여기서 어르신마저 돌아가시면 그 업을 죽어서도 다 못 갚을 겁니다.”놀라운 얘기였지만 반응할 여력이 없었다. 그러나 오는 내가 듣든 말든 아랑곳 않고 담담하게 얘기를 이어 나갔다. 그의 말은 이렇다.그의 고향에서 그는 어린 시절부터 또래보다 힘이 세고 덩치가 큰데다 포악한 성격으로 잘 알려져 있었다. 특히나 자기 아내가 얽힌 일이면 더 거칠어져서 언젠가 부턴 마을사람들이 그 두 사람을 모두 피했다. 아내를 위하자는 욕심에 다른 사람에게 못되게 군 일이 많았다. 누구라도 오의 심기를 거스르다간 해코지를 당하곤 했으므로 사람들이 오의 눈치를 보며 벌벌 떨기 일쑤였다. 교역을 다녀와서 그가 아내의 자결 소식을 들었을 때, 그는 길길이 날뛰며 마을 사람들을 들볶았다. 소문에 의하면 아내는 죽기 전날 밤중에 친정을 나와 자기 집으로 향했다. 그 이유에 대해 아는 사람은 없었다. 또 행상 어르신이 보통 마을에 찾아와 삼일 이상 머무는 경우가 없었는데 이상하게도 그때는 아내가 죽기 전날까지 근 십 일을 머물렀다는 것이다. 그리고 그 행상 어르신이 처남과 몇 번 무슨 얘기를 하는 것을 본 사람이 있고 그 행상은 오의 아내가 죽기 전날까지도 마을 근처에 야숙을 하다가 언제 떠났는지 아무도 모르게 마을에서 사라졌다고 했다. 오는 처남을 추궁했으나 모르쇠로 일관하는 태도에 화를 참을 수 없어 처남을 나무 몽둥이로 패기 시작했고 결국 처남의 다리가 부러지도록 때렸다. 그리고 행상이 이 일에 연관이 있다는 확신을 가지고 그를 좇겠다며 길을 나서 여러 고을을 전전하며 그의 행방을 수소문한다.그런 기약 없는 추적이 넉 달쯤 지난 날 마침내 행상을 한 조그마한 마을에서 찾게 된다. 거기서 오는 행상이 바닥에 널어놓은 물건들 가운데 자신이 예전에 아내에게 선물한 비녀가 있음을 보게 된다.불같이 화가 난 오는 다음 장을 향해 떠나는 행상을 산속에서 기다렸다가 덮치고 아내의 일을 추궁했다. 이미 오의 처남이 다 실토하였다고 거짓을 하며 그를 몰아 세웠으나 행상은 그러나 자신은 아무것도 모른다고, 자신은 오의 아내가 죽은 사실도 방금 알았노라고 잡아떼었다. 오는 비녀 얘기를 꺼냈고 그 순간 당황한 행상을 보게 된다. 오는 이런 행상의 행동을 보고 참지 못하고 결국 그를 돌로 쳐 죽였다.여기까지 설명하고 오는 입을 멈췄다. 그리고 잠시 후 어쩌면 자신의 저지른 과거의 악행이 업으로 쌓여 모두 아내에게 돌려져 화가 된 게 아닐까 자책하며 흐느꼈다. 나는 가까스로 입문을 열었다.“그럼 정확히 어찌 아내가 죽게 된 일인지는 아무도 모르는 겐가? 그것도 서글픈 일이 아닌가...”“오만생각을 다했습니다만... 모르겠습니다... 그냥 돈을 번답시고 아내 곁을 떠나지 말았더라면... 아내는 제가 구해다 준 호신용 칼로 자결했다는데 그 칼을 사주지 않았더라면... 아니면 애초에 아내가 저 같은 걸 만나지 않았더라면... 아니면, 또 아니면... 그렇게 괴로운 생각이 머리를 잠시도 떠나 있질 않았습니다. 또 정말 생각하기 괴롭지만... 아내가 겁간을 당한 건 아닐까... 예전에 아내 앞에서 키우던 암캐를 마구 차버린 적이 있습니다... 아무 놈이나 다 붙어 먹는다고... 그래서... 그 때문은 아닐까요. 아니면 대체...”오는 멈추어 서서 다 자신의 잘못이라며 격하게 울기 시작했다. 죄송하다며 나를 내려놓고는 한동안 아이처럼 울고 있는 오를 지켜보는 게 괴로웠다. 오는 어느덧 울음을 그치더니,“죄송합니다. 어르신, 추한 꼴을 보여서... 속이 답답하기도 하였고 어르신이 절 좋은 사람이라고 추켜 세워 주시는 말씀에 도저히 마음이 켕겨 이렇게 털어 놓지 않고는 배길 수가 없습니다...”“추하긴 무엇이 추한가...”몸이 노곤했으나 무엇이든 오를 위로하는 말을 하고 싶었지만 할 말을 찾지 못했다. 오는 길을 서둘러야 한다며 다시 나를 업어 메고 다시 발을 옮겼다. 그의 등에 업혀 가다가 나는,“자네는 자네가 악한 사람이라고 하지만, 자 들어 보게. 글자를 모르는 사람이 글자를 아는 행세를 한다고 해도 그건 금방 표가 나게 돼 있거든... 나같이 떠벌리기 잘하는 사람이 곧잘 창피를 당하는 것도 마찬가지지... 나는 자네가 말하는 과거에 대해서는 모르나 지금 보는 모습에 일말의 거짓이나 꾸밈도 찾을 수가 없네... 설령 그것이 흉내에 불과하다고 치세... 자네의 마음이 선하지 않다면 어찌 선한 사람을 이처럼 완벽하게 흉내 낼 수가 있겠나... 자네는 선할 사람일세. 선의의 방향이 너무나 한 곳으로 몰려 있으면 반대쪽에서 보기에는 이기적이고 포악한 모습으로 비출 수 있지. 그러나 모든 사람은, 아니 미물도 마찬가지로 이기적이지 않은가. 누군가를 위하여 헌신하는 건 아무나 할 수 있는 일은 아니거든. 나는 자네 같은 사람이 세상에 있어야 한다고 생각하네. 혹 승냥이의 탈을 쓰고 있든, 호랑이의 가죽을 몸에 둘렀든, 자네 마음에 있는 선의가 사라질 거라고는 생각할 수가 없구만. 사람은 누구나 잘못을 하지 않는가. 그러나 잘못은 고칠 수 있어. 다시 한 번 말하지만 자네 같은 사람이 살아남아 세상에 사는 게 이 세상에 훨씬 이로운 일이 아닌가...”나는 마지막 말을 하기 전에 가까스로, 나 같은 늙은이가 살아남는 것보단 자네가 사는 게 낫다는 뒷말을 감출 수 있었다.“그렇지 않습니다... 사실 어르신, 전 처음부터 죽을 작정이었습니다... 아내의 혼이 좋은 곳에 가있었으면 하는 바람뿐이었습니다... 그곳이 아내가 좋아하던 나잘일 수도 있겠다는 생각을 했구요... 단 한번이라도... 어떻게든 아내를 다시 보고 싶었습니다. 아니, 사실 보지 못할 거라고, 닿지 못할 거라고 생각했습니다. 제가 죄인이니까요... 그러니까 어르신이 가고자 하는 나잘을 죽을 장소로 여긴 본심을 숨기고 함께 온 것이죠... 또 죄를 지은 겁니다... 천신이 보시길 이런 저에게 노하지 않으실 수 있겠습니까...”“그것이 어찌 죄가 되겠는가, 그런 죄라면 나는 골백번 죽어야 마땅하지... 내가 마음으로 죽인 사람은 몇인가 셀 수도 없네 그려.” 나는 한참 기침을 하다가 말을 이었다.“살인을 했다는 거 말일세. 분명히 흉악스럽기야 하지만 어쨌든 명분이 있었던 게 아닌가... 한순간에 자네의 모든 걸 잃었으니 미쳐버렸다고 한들 탓하기만 할 수도 없는 일이구... 또 지금은 그렇지 않잖은가... 이처럼 끈질기게 사람을 구하려는 인내가 필부가 가질 수 있는 범주 내에 있다고 생각할 수가 없구먼.”“그렇지 않습니다... 사실...”“적어도 난 그렇다고 생각하네. 자네를 내가 본 나잘로 말이야. 사실 그렇게 생각하지 않으면 이대로 죽기는 좀 억울하잖은가. 사람이란 저가 믿고 싶은 걸 믿는 법이니 뭐, 이까짓 것을 알자고 너무 고생스러운 길을 왔구먼. 온몸이 너무 아파서 차라리 죽는 게 나은 심정이네. 이보게, 오. 죄책감 같은 것일랑 가지지 말고 나를 두고 가게. 이러다간 둘이가 다 죽겠어.”“곧 괜찮아 지실 겁니다. 조금만 참으십쇼.”“아니야, 내가 잘 알지. 더군다나 살아야 쓸데없는 늙은이라. 여보게, 오. 내가 나잘을 왜 찾았는지 아는가?”“어렸을 때부터 나잘을 믿으신 것 아닙니까?”“아니지 아니야. 우습지만 나는 내가 이런 세상에 어울리지 않는 사람이라고 생각했네. 온갖 멍청이들로 가득 찬 세상에서 홀로 깨쳐 있다고, 내가 바로 나잘에 갈 만한 사람이라고...” 기침이 또 터졌다.“그렇게 생각한 인간이... 마누라가 힘써 모은 돈, 아들내미 장가가는데 보태겠다고 살뜰히 모아논 걸 다 들고 도망 나왔지. 와령에 닿기까지 있는 기생집이란 기생집은 다 들르면서. 모르긴 몰라도 오 자네를 만나지 않았다면 와령에서 돈을 다 써버릴 때까지 눌러 앉았을 거야. 그래서 내가 자네에게 고맙게 생각하는 거네. 살아 쓸모없는 영감에게 나잘도 보여주고 묘자리도 내주었으니까...”“잘못은 고칠 수 있다고 하지 않으셨습니까. 괜찮아 지실 겁니다.”“다 늙어 고친 들 어디에 쓸 꼬. 자네 같은 젊은이야 얼마든 다시 살 방도가 있겠다만...”영호는 대답하지 않고 묵묵히 걸음을 옮겼다.시간이 어찌 가는 줄도 모르고 정신을 놓고 오의 등에 업혀 간혹 깰 때마다 오히려 죽을 맛이었다. 늙은 몸이어도 통증을 느끼는 능력만은 젊은이 못지않은 탓에 바람은 잘 벼린 칼날처럼 살을 후비고 아픔이 극에 달한 팔과 다리는 차라리 끊겨 없어지길 바라는 심정이었다.몇 번인가 죽음으로 착각할 정도로 기분 좋은 잠이 들었다. 한번은 밤중에 잠을 깼는데 밤하늘이 한눈에 들어왔다. 고요했다. 구름은 저의 자릴 내주고 어딜 갔는지 이 하늘은 혀가 열 개라도 된 들 한 티끌만치라도 비판할 구석이 없으며, 그저 보는 이로 하여금 거대한 세계의 일부라도 된 양 크나큰 자부심을 안겨 주는 것이었다. 하늘, 아니, 천지가 뒤집혀 바다가 저 위에 조용히 흐르고 있었다. 몽롱한 정신에 육신의 무게가 일절 느껴지지 않고 나는, 구름, 저 하늘에서 도망 나온 구름을 탄 기분을 느꼈다. 이 무슨 신묘한 경이인가. 아님 내가 죽어 나잘에 왔단 말인가. 그렇게 넋을 놓고 바라보다가 내가 아직 움직이고 있음을 깨달았다. 아니, 오는 이 밤중에 나를 업고 아직도 걷고 있었다. 나는 방금 전에 내가 느낀 신비한 경험을 아니 말할 수 없어,“하늘. 보고 있는가? 살면서 이처럼 감동한 일이 없는데, 아름답네, 아름다워”했더니 오는 규칙적인 호흡을 뱉을 뿐 아무 답이 없었다. 한참 있다가 그는“매일 보던 것과 별 다를 게 없어 보입니다만.” 라고 말했다.“죽어서 나잘에 온 줄만 알았네 그려... 아니, 차라리 내가 죽어야 자네라도 좀 편할텐데.”매번 그런 말씀 말라던 오는, 그때는 조용히 침묵했다. 그러다 한참 후,“나잘이 있기만 하다면... 살아만 계시면 언제든 보게 되지 않겠습니까. 제가 무슨 일이 있어도 마을에 모셔다 드릴테니... 조금만 참으십쇼. 조금만... 이제 거의 다 왔습니다.”“내가 죽을지 살지는 신령님만 아시겠으나 자네 마을에 닿거든... 새 삶을 찾으시게. 아직 젊지 않은가. 어디 먼 데로 떠나 살면 누가 자네 치부를 들출까. 아니, 난 오히려 자네가 한 일들이 합당한 일이었다고, 마땅히 자네가 해야 했던 복수라고 생각하네만. 어찌 되었거나 한 가정을 풍비 박살낸 사내인데...”오는 한참 입을 열지 않았다. 내가 정신이 다시 몽롱해지고 오한이 들어 지친 잠에 들기 직전에 그는 말했다.“그 비녀 말입니다...”내가 반쯤 잠이 들 때까지 뜸을 들이다가 그는 말을 이었다.“그 죽은 행상의 봇짐을 뒤졌는데... 그... 아내가 갖고 있던 비녀랑 똑같은 물건이 여러 개 있었습니다... 그걸 보았을 때 돌로 머리를 맞은 듯 하고 잠깐 다른 세상에 와 있는 거처럼 묘한 기분이 들었습니다. 갑자기 물이 흐르는 것도, 바람이 부는 자연한 이치도 죄다 이상히 여겨지고... 아무튼 그랬습니다. 그때 상황이 어떻게 벌어진 일인가, 사람이 왜 여기 죽어 있는지, 왜 이렇게 돼 버렸는가 알 수도 없고, 아는 것도 두려웠습니다... 도망쳤습니다. 그냥 무작정... 그런데 아무리 도망을 쳐도... 항상 마음이 무겁고 고됩니다... 이제 저승에 가서 죗값을 치르는 일 밖에는 남지 않은 것 같습니다.”이것이 내가 오와 나눈 마지막 대화이다.나른한 날이다. 햇빛이 기분 좋게 쬐고 눈길엔 아무 거리낄 게 없다. 보이는 것은 사람인 즉, 나는 이 장면을 오래전에 본 기억이 있다. 첫 애를 낳고 모유를 먹이느라 젖가슴을 헤친 아낙네의 모습, 내 아내의 모습, 아니, 이건 내 어머니의 모습이던가, 보이는 것은 뚜렷하건만 누가 이리 추잡하고 체면 없이 쭉쭉 소리를 내며 젖꼭지를 빨아 대는 양인지 알 도리가 없다. 다만 해가 따스하게 피부에 닿는 것이 좋으며, 내 아들놈인지, 어쩌면 나인지 모를, 아니, 뭐든 간에 소중히 꼭 안아진 이것, 아니, 저것이라고 해도 좋을 테다, 여튼 누가 느끼던 간에 요람은 더없이 포근하고 안전하여, 나는ㅡ아, 이것은 나의 모습이라고 밖에 생각할 수 없다ㅡ, 마치 지금 아주 오랜 기억을 들추어내듯 머릿속에 꼭 숨어 형체조차 분간 못하던 그 나잘, 나잘을 보는 듯싶다. 아, 나잘, 나잘, 가고 싶던 그 곳, 아니 가보려 했던 곳인가? 가보았던 곳인가? 가보려고 했은 즉 이유는 또 무엇이며, 나는, 아니 저것은, 저것은 이담에 크면 저 품을 언젠가 뛰쳐나와 광인 마냥 있지도 않은 망상을 향해 달리는 것인가? 나인지 뭣인지 모를 것의 추태ㅡ아직도 쭉쭉 대는 추잡한 상놈의 자식ㅡ는 아무튼 풍경에 녹아 흐물흐물한, 흐리멍덩한 양상으로 하나의 장면 장면마다 그 묘연함과 역겨움이 모자람 없이 덕지덕지 보태지고 한바탕 우그러진다. 그리고, 그러나, 그 빌어먹게 뿌연 정경은 억센 감동의 크기와 동일한 몸집으로ㅡ왜인지는 누구라서 알겠는가ㅡ, 불시에 아주 아주 명확히, 보다 더 크고, 더 사나운 파도로 둔갑하여 육박해 온다. 나는 그 파도의 위세에 잔뜩 겁에 질려 도망하는 마음이었다가 갑작스레 따스함이 느껴지는 근원지가 눈가라는 것을 알았다. 눈에서 파도가 쓸려 나간다. 그 후로는 또 정신을 잃은 듯하다. 괴상한 꿈이로다.밥 짓는 냄새다. 오장육부의 곳곳에 숨어 자세를 낮게 깔고 잠자던 생기들이 고개를 치어 들고 예의 꿈속 파도 마냥 일시에 돌진해온다. 또, 약 달이는 냄새다. 조청보다 달콤하고, 좋은 술보다 향기롭다. 정신이 깨지 않은 중에도 몸은 솔직하게 삶의 실마리를 구걸하며, 그 한 줌 향기마저 놓칠까 게걸스럽게 먹어 치운다. 사유는 저의 기능을 상실하고 아직도 모래바다 위에 표류하는 게 분명하건만, 그러나 혼을 잃고도 사람의 몸은 제가 평생 해오던 일을 정직하게 답습했다.가까스로 말을 할 수 있게 된 건 며칠이나 자리에 누워 있은 후인지 알 수 없다.옆에 누가 있는지 없는지 알지도 못하고 힘겹게 입을 열어 고맙다는 말을 한다. 몇 번쯤 반복하고 나니 기력을 잃어 다시 정신을 잃었다.기름의 향, 죽의 냄새. 확실히 이전엔 썩 좋아하진 않았지만 필시 당면한 내 최고의 만찬이 될 그 냄새다.“정신이 드슈?”나는 눈만 돌려 그쪽을 쳐다보았다.“아들내미가 밤중인지 새벽인지 누가 집 헛간에 송장을 버려 두고 갔다고 해서 얼마나 놀란 지 모르우. 어쩌다 거기 계셨는지는 모르겠지만 아무튼 사람은 살려야 겠다 싶어 봇짐을 좀 뒤져서 쌀도 사고 약도 사고 하였으니 섭섭하게 생각하지 않으셨으면 좋겠구만요. 원체 변변찮은 살림이라...”부인은 눈을 흘겨 무언갈 가리키는 듯 했으나, 눈을 돌릴 기력조차 없었다. 괜찮다고, 고맙다고 시원하게 말 할 수 없는 분함도 있었건만 그 부인은 내 눈을 보곤 대충 알아들은 눈치라 더 애쓸 필요는 없었다.그렇게 또 얼마를 산송장으로 일면식 없는 집에 신세를 졌는지 모른다. 하루하루 또 늙어갔다.다시 눈을 떴을 때, 몸이야 제 것 같지 않은 그대로였으나 정신만은 청명하였다. 참새가 울어댄 즉, 주변에 아직 먹을 게 있고 곧 여기 사람이 있다고 알리는 소리다. 나도 나의 생을 증명하기 위해 간헐적인 숨을 내쉰다. 들이쉬는 숨에 악취가 딸려 들어왔다. 그게 의미하는 바에 수치심을 느끼기보다 이 뒤처리를 도맡아 해온 누군가에 무한히 미안한 마음, 또 고마운 맘이 일었다. 조잡한 천장에 황토벽은 울퉁불퉁 발려 잘난 구석이 없으며 밥상 하나 외에 살림이랄 것도 일절 없는 방이다. 나는 무덤을 떠올리고 말았다. 이건 누군가 사람이 죽기에 앞서 새로운 환경에 당황치 않도록 예비해 놓은, 즉 무덤 생활에 적응하기 위한 체험만 같다. 당최 유쾌하지 못하다. 그러나 그런 생각을 하고는 크게 웃을 뻔 했다. 역시나 웃을 힘이 없었다.시간이 얼마간 지나고 부인이 찾아 왔다. 부인은 내가 모처럼 눈을 뜨고 있는 걸 보고 짐짓 놀란 표정을 짓더니 좀 어떠시냐고 말을 건다. 오늘은 썩 정신이 맑다고, 고맙다는 대답을 했다. 부인은 얘기하는 내내 문을 열어 환기를 하고, 내 누운 자리를 돌봐 주었다. 부인은 내가 어디 사람인지, 무슨 변고로 이 지경이 됐는지 등을 물어보았으나 여러 물음에 다 대답할 상태가 못 되었고 간략히 줄여 말할 일도 아녔다. 나중에 다 얘기하겠노라 하니 부인은 더 궁금해 하지 않았다. 그리고는,“아참, 지금은 정신이 계시니 말인데 의원이 왔다 가며 말하길 기력이 많이 쇠했다고 하면서 보약을 좀 써야겠다던대... 그전에 받아왔던 약일랑은 몇 푼 안하지만 요번 건 값이 꽤 나가서... 제 돈이 아니니 함부로 쓸 수두 없구, 어찌 할까요?”“내가 가진 게 약값으로 모자라지 않거든 그렇게 해 주시오.” 하니 부인은 알겠다고 내 봇짐을 뒤져 돈을 헤아린다. 다음 밖을 향해,“얘, 호돌아!(이름 바꿀 것) 이거 가지고 약방 가서 약 받아오너라.” 라 외쳤다. 그러자 조금 있다 한 청년이 발을 절며 문지방을 넘어 방으로 기어 들어왔다. 호돌이라 불린 청년은 움직임이 굼뜨고 발을 불편하게 절뚝거리는 게 젊은 사람 행동 치고 거슬리는 면이 있었다. 그러던 중 불현 한 가지 생각이 든 나는 먹던 죽을 일시에 게우고 꺼억꺼억 대며 오열했다.놀란 부인과 호돌이(반드시 바꿀 것)는 눈에 뵈지 않고 난 속으로 외치기를,‘아! 이 못난이는!’이 이야기는 평생 영영 결단코 나잘에 갈 수 없는 사람의 이야기라.끝.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/novels/200414-나잘-가는-길2_미완.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Writings/Novels/200414 - 나잘 가는 길2_미완.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 07 Dec 2024 08:45:50 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[221029 - 여자로 살아간다는 것]]></title><description><![CDATA[고민해본 적 없는 일을 고민해보는 것은 제법 유쾌한 일이다. 성전환자의 심리를 궁금해한 적은 있지만서도 여자로 살아가는 것에 대해 생각해 본 일은 통 없다. 나기를 남자로 났으니 그럴 수도 있고, 굳이 성별을 나누어 무언가를 생각한다는 게 익숙하지 않은 탓도 있겠다. 그래서 한번 유쾌한 고민을 해본다.
내가 여자라고 가정을 해본다. 본래 주관이 강하니 지금 내 모습과 별반 다를 것도 없겠다는 생각을 한다. 그리고 나는 지금 아무 생각이 없다. 정말 아무 생각이 없기 때문이다.
없는 말을 지어내고 꾸미는 재주가 없으니 사는 일이 매양 건조하기 이를 데 없는 사람은 바로 이렇다. 남자라서 그러한 것이 아니고, 그냥 사람이 이러하니 이런 것이다. 아마 내가 여자였다면 조금은 더 감성적일까 같은 물음은 애초에 염두의 말미를 건드리지조차 못한다. 남자라서, 아니면 여자라서, 애초에 그 둘을 구별하여 얻을 실익이 어디에 있는지 분간이 없으니, 나는 상대에 대한 배려가 없는 통 못 쓸 인간일 수도 있겠다. 못 쓸 남자가 아니라, 못 쓸 인간 말이다. 한 명의 페미니스트였던 어머니의 등을 기억한다. 그 모습은 일면 여리지만 강인했고, 또 당신의 넓지 않은 그 등속에 마치 바다를 닮은 사랑을 간직했음을 기억한다. 소외된 사람, 약자를 지나치지 못하는 어머니의 심성과 행동들은, 내 속마음 깊숙이 당최 닿기 어려운 외딴곳에 작은 씨앗을 하나 심어 놓았다. 그리고 메마른 토지와 같은 내 마음에 심어진 그 씨앗이 기어코 살아남고 발아하여 사랑이라는 낱말이 되었다. 대상의 구별이 없는 지극하고 고귀한 사랑은 아닐지 언정, 내 주변 정도는 다소 아름답고 온화하게 가꾸는 고마운 말이다.
평등은 그 해석과 의미가 다양한 말이다. 배움이 짧아 아직 평등의 실마리를 잡지 못하였지만, 언뜻 느끼길 내 마음의 그 작고 소중한 낱말이 평등을 이해하는 데 큰 도움을 줄 것만 같다. 그러므로 나는 비록 ‘여성으로 살아가는 것’이 어떤 일인지 짐작조차 못 하면서도 그 어감의 단초를 잡아, 추론을 한다. 그리고 마땅히 세상에 여러 부류의 사람이 있음을 생각하고, 그저 작은 스푼 하나로 내 마음의 눈곱만한 좋은 부분을 눈곱의 눈곱만큼 정도는 덜어내어 주기를 결심한다.‘나와 다른 것을 인정하고, 이해하려고 노력하는 것.’ 같이 살아간다는 것은 단순한 이익관계에 의한 화합 따위는 아닐 테다. 계산이 있는 곳엔 숫자가 남을 것이고, 배려가 있는 곳엔 온기가 남을 것이다. 그리고 그 온기는 다른 사람의 마음 또한 온화하게 덥혀 또 다른 이의 시린 맘을 감싸주지 않겠는가.
다분히 이상적인 말일 테지만, 내가 없는 말을 보태어 특별히 여성을 옹호하는 가식을 내비치기 보단 이 편이 나은 듯싶다. 적어도 내가 본 많은 여성들은, 옹호할 대상이 아니라 존중할 대상이었고, 개개의 삶이 훌륭해 때로 우러러볼 일도 많았던 기억이 난다. 그리고 이 얘기는 꼭 여성에 국한된 얘기만은 아닐 것이다.
마찬가지로 내 어머니가 그토록 아름다울 수 있었던 이유가 꼭 여자이기 때문만은 아니길 소망하며 이즈음 한가지 기대를 품어 본다.
나 또한 먼 훗날 언젠가 내가 받은 씨앗에서 열매를 맺고, 그 씨앗을 또한 누군가의 마음에 심어줄 수 있기를. 그리고 그 씨앗 또한 언젠가 열매를 맺기를.
그 작고 볼품없는 씨앗은 보기와 달리 어찌나 강인한지, 한겨울에도 싹을 틔우더라.후기
이 글을 읽은 어떤 분이 "여자의 입장도 좀 생각하시며 사시죠." 라는 코멘트를 달았다. 나는 젠더 갈등의 근본 원인에 대해 다시금 생각하지 않을 수 없었다.

"누난 꼭 술 마시면 그 소리 하더라."
핀잔 아닌 핀잔을 매번 주게 되는 건 멋 없는 사람의 숙명인지 이번에도 또 이렇게 답하고 말았다. 적어도 대화가 슬픈 종막을 향해 뻗는 것이 아닌 게 다행이고, 곧 이게 산 사람이 지향해야 할 삶의 방향이다. 대략 이런 비루한 철학을 갖고 다시 말하건대, 추억할 수 있는 한 때를 공통으로 지닌 사람들이 관계를 지속하기에 가장 좋은 점은 바로 이런 것이다. 말하고 또 말해도 질리지 않는 무언가를 서로 공유하고 있다는 것. 어린 시절 한 동네에 살았던 사촌 누나와는 제법 이야기할 거리가 많다. 가령 나와 누나가 부모님을 따라 같이 중이염을 치료하러 갔던 일. 치료를 받고 울면서 나오는 누나를 내가 그정도에 우냐며 많이 놀렸던 일. 그리고 그 직후에 치료를 받으러 들어가서는 정작 나는 바지에 오줌을 싼 일. 이를 테면 다 좋은 추억들이다. 적어도 함부로 입을 놀리면 그게 평생 놀릴 거리가 돼서 나를 따라다닐 수 있다는 교훈을 얻은 점에선. 다른 사촌들과는 유별나게 이 사촌 누나와 마음의 거리가 가까운 것도 다 이런 공유하는 사건들이 있어서라는 생각이 들었다. 그리고 그 병원에서 서럽게 울던 어린 여자아이가 벌써 두 아이의 엄마가 되고, 오줌을 싼 녀석은 결혼 못한 노총각으로 남아서 서로의 삶의 행태가 많이 달라졌음에도 여전히 가끔 전화를 주고 받을 수 있는 건 기억의 어딘가에 깊게 수몰된 예전의 자신들을, 서로가 서로를 건져 올려줄 수 있는 그런 관계이기 때문인 것 같다. 엄마가 된 사촌 누나는 즉 그에게서 작은 엄마인, 우리 엄마에 대한 얘기를 종종 꺼내곤 했다.(물론 내가 시작하는 경우가 더 많긴 할 테지만) 그리고 내가 6살이고 누나가 7살이던 무렵, 우리 엄마랑 같이 도너츠를 만들던 얘기는 이야기의 단골 주제였다. 엄마가 사 온 도너츠 가루 믹스를 물과 섞어서 몸에 반죽 칠갑을 하면서 어렵게 반죽을 만들고, 고사리손인데다가 없는 솜씨로 꾸역꾸역 모양을 내고. 나는 도넛이 죄다 구멍이 뚫린 원형인 모양이 너무 재미가 없어서 별모양이라든지, 항상 이상한 모양의 도너츠를 만들었다. 그리고 그걸 튀겨 먹었다. 그게 몇 번 반복되니 사촌 누나는 왜 도넛이 보통 구멍이 뚫린 원형인지 알게 된 눈치였지만, 여전히 난 배가 볼록하게 튀어나온 덜 익은 별 모양의 도넛을 먹었다. ##내가 기억하는 내 유년시절의 가장 아름다운 부분들이란 마찬가지로 이런 범상함의 범주 안에서 대게 크게 벗어나지 않는다. 크게 풍족할 것도 없었고, 작금과 비교하면 불편하고 일면 지루할 수도 있는 그런 시시한 일상의 기억들. 모임에 다녀온 아비는 술에 취해서 까끌까끌한 수염이 난 턱으로 아이의 얼굴을 비비고, 아이는 그게 싫어서 도망을 다니고, 집을 오래 비운 아비에게 아이는 우리 집에 한번 놀러 오라며 전화를 하고, 가끔은 경양식집에 가서 외식을 하고, 서점에 가서 함께 책을 고르고, 꽉 막힌 도로에 갇혔을 적에는 차 안에서 군것질거리나 까먹고, 터미널 앞에서 파는 군밤이 몹시 먹고 싶어서 어머니를 조르고, 그런 아이를 어머니는 한번도 다그치지 못하고, 어머니가 글을 쓰고, 그 등을 보며 아이도 글을 쓰고.
이런 두서 없게만 늘어질만한 모든 일상의 기억들을 아마 나는 예전부터 '행복'이라 부르기로 스스로 약조를 한 것인지, 달리 계기가 없고도 이런 옛날이 생각날 때면 저도 몰래 미소를 짓곤 하는 것이다.(물론 이건 동시에 아프기도 한 일일테다.) 이렇게 쓰고 보면 특별할 것 없는 보통의 일상으로만 보이는데, 당사자들에게는 왜 그렇게 애틋할 수 있는지 종종 생각하게 된다. 반죽도 형편 없고, 맛도 기괴해서 도저히 상품성이라곤 없는 그런 도너츠를 만들어 먹던 기억이 왜 그렇게 인상이 깊었을까. 요즈음의 시대 관점이라면 그 재료비와 노력이면 차라리 도너츠를 사 먹는 게 합리적이라는 논리가 옳을 법도 한데 왜 우리는 그런 비합리적이고 이상한 행동들을 더 오래 기억하는 걸까? ㅡ라고 파고 들면 얘기가 너무 길어질 거 같아 각설하고 나의 의견을 덧붙이는 것으로 대신하자면, 그 기억 안에는 나의 주체적인 감정과 경험이 있기 때문이다.(이런 관점에서 보자면, 우린 돈을 내고 주체적인 감정과 경험이 더해진 더 오래 남을 기억들을 포기하는 셈일 수도 있겠다.)
@@@@@@@다음에@@@@@@@@@내 큰 조카는 벌써 6살이 되었다. 도너츠를 만들기 좋은 나이다. 한창 개구진 나이라 까불기도 잘 까불고 생명력이 왕성해서 불쌍한 삼촌을 데리고 잘 놀아주기도 한다. 고마운 조카를 위하여 다음 번에는 시시한 장난감을 사주는 대신에 함께 도너츠를 만들어 보면 어떨까 한다. 아니면, 할로윈 때에 맞춰서 다같이 잭-오-랜턴을 만들어도 좋겠다. 그리고 할로윈이 끝나고 나면 그 호박머리를 으깨셔, 생크림과 계란, 시나몬, 너트맥 등을 넣고, 또 파이지를 만들어서 함께 고소한 땅콩 호박파이를 구워 먹어도 좋겠다. 그리고 호박파이가 너무 맛이 없어서, 다들 웃음보가 터지면 그보다 더 좋을 일은 없겠다.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/essays/240127-엄마.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Writings/Essays/240127 -

잘하겠어. 자신감도 떨어지고 맨날 긴장한 상태라 눈치만 보는데.”“뭐, 그 사람 입장도 입장이지만, 사장 쪽 입장에서도 생각해 봐야지. 말도 잘 안 통하고 눈치도 없는 사람을 계속 고용하는 건 사장한테도 손해잖아.”“아니, 그러니까 그럼 좀 미리 얘기를 해서 다른 일을 구해볼 시간을 좀 주는 게 맞다는 거지 내 말은.”세진은 손까지 저어가며 말을 했다.“당신도 새로 온 직원이 일 못 해서 잔일만 늘어났다고 푸념하더니. 왜 갑작스레 그 사람의 충실한 변호인이 되셨을까?”“일을 못 하는 건 못하는 거고 해고는 다른 얘기지. 내 말뜻 다 알면서 말을 돌린다?”“뭐, 어쨌든 우리가 고용인은 아니니까. 그 부분은 고용인과 피고용인이 풀 문제라고 생각하는데요, 서세진 씨?”“외국인 노동자 법에는 그런... 뭐 없나?”“정규직도 아닌데다 일한지 얼마 되지도 않았는데... 힘들지. 그리고 그런 법이 있다 한들 그 법을 어떻게 알아보고 자기 권리를 구제해달라고 진정을 넣어? 우리말도 모르는데.”“아니 안 좋은 방향으로만 말하지 말고, 오늘 윤이 사장한테 그만 두라고 바득바득 한소리 듣고 나서 얘가 어딜 갔나 보니까 화장실에서 울고 있더라니까? 가만히 있기 뭐해서 무슨 일이냐고 언니한테 다 말해보라고 하니까 윤이 글쎄. 언니, 돈없어요, 일없어요. 하면서 우는데...”“윤이 그 사람이 당신보다 나이가 많다고 하지 않았어?”“주방 이모들도 그렇고 우리가 다 그냥 여자직원들을 언니라고 부르라고 해서 그렇지. 말을 잘 못하니까 동생처럼 챙겨줘야 하는 느낌도 나고, 아무튼 그게 문제가 아니라, 불쌍해서 어째 우리 윤.”“사정이 얼마나 안 좋은 건데? 윤, 그 여자 가족은 있고?”“남편이랑 둘이 산다는 거 같은데, 자세한 건 모르지. 아무튼 집세 낼 돈도 빠듯한가봐. 남편은 일도 안 하고 있다 그러지. 그러면서도 도와달라고 말은 못하고 울기만 하고. 말 못하고 낑낑대는 강아지 같더라니까?”“사정이야 딱해도 뭐 어떡해. 우리가 그 사람들 고용해줄 수 있는 거도 아니고.”“윤이 저렇게 그만 두고 나면 맘이 너무 불편할 거 같으니까 그러지, 걱정 되고.”“정 맘 불편하면 도와줄 방법이 있나 찾아보든가. 왜 요새 농촌에도 외국인들이 와서 일 많이 한다며, 그쪽으로 알아봐도 좋고.”“우리 집도 좀 있으면 마늘하고 고추 뽑기 시작할 텐데. 한번 전화해볼까?”“알아봐서 나쁠 건 없지.”세진은 안방에 들어가 충전중이던 자신의 핸드폰을 뽑아 들고 즉시 자신의 어머니에게 전화를 걸었다. 그녀는 한참을 통화하고 끊고 거실로 돌아왔다.“요새 해안에도 태국인들이 많이 와 있나봐? 엄마 하는 말 들으니까 이제 외국인 없으면 농사도 못 짓는다는데?”“우리나라도 이제 다른 선진국들이랑 비슷한 문화가 생기겠네.”“어떤 문화?”“뭐, 워킹홀리데이 비자나 이민 장려하는 제도나 그런 거 있잖아. 그런 나라들이 외국 사람들한테 비자나 영주권 주면서 자국민들 기피하는 산업을 맡기듯이.”“나 어려서 시골 살 때만해도 국제 결혼하는 사람들이 종종 있었는데. 우리 옆집 아저씨도 베트남 아가씨 얻어서 결혼했고. 그래도 외국 사람이 많이 산다는 생각은 해본 적 없는데 이제는 좀 본격적인가 봐. 우리야 명절 때나, 중요한 일 있을 때나 한 번씩 가는 게 전부니까 잘 몰랐는데, 세상이 많이 바뀌긴 했다.”“그래서 장모님이랑 통화한 건? 일손은 좀 필요하시대?”“응, 동네에 외국인들 모아 놓고, 그 뭐야 인력사무소처럼 해놓고 중개해주는 사람이 또 있나 봐. 그쪽에서 사람들 불러다 쓰면 하루에 8만원은 줘야 된대. 우리 부모님도 다 나이 드셔서 계속 일 해줄 사람 있음 좋긴 하겠다고 하시던데.”“그 윤 씨 연락처는 갖고 있어?”“걔 핸드폰 개통도 안 해서 번호는 없고, 페이스북 메신저로는 연락할 수 있어.”“농사일이 힘들어서 하려고 할지 모르겠네. 그나마 더운 나라 출신이라 더위는 안 타려나? 사람 쓰게 되면 월급은 얼마나 주신대?”“몰라, 아직 물어보진 않았는데, 보통 얼마나 주는지 보고 그만큼 주면 되지 않을까?”그러자 용국은 핸드폰으로 뭔가 하는가 싶더니,“요새 최저시급으로 따지면 주40시간 기준 한 달에 180만원은 줘야 되네.”“두 명이면 360만원이네. 그것도 꽤 부담이긴 하다.”“장인이랑 장모님 연세면 일하기도 힘드실 건데, 몸에 무리도 가고... 농사짓던 규모는 계속 그대로 유지하시니까... 뭐 투자라고 생각하면 나쁘진 않지. 그전에도 수확 철에는 사람 불러다 쓰고 했잖아? 그 비용도 꽤 들 텐데 아무튼 다 따져서 계산해보고 뭐가 더 유리한지 셈하면 되지. 그리고 윤 씨 그분 의견도 들어야 되고.”“암튼 당장 내일이라도 윤이한테 연락해서 물어보기부터 할 게.”이튿날 세진이 자신이 일하는 식당에 나갔을 때, 정말 윤의 모습은 보이지 않았다. 내심 사장이 맘을 돌려 먹고 윤에게 출근하라고 연락하진 않았을까 기대했던 세진은 못내 아쉬운 맘이 들었다. 그녀는 메신저를 통해 윤에게 메시지를 남겼다. 금방 답이 돌아왔다.//퇴근하고 돌아온 세진은 진이 빠져서 현관문을 열었다. “왔어?” 하는 소리가 거실로부터 들린다. 용국이다. 세진은 대충 신을 벗어 놓고 거실로 들어갔다. 그리고 곧장 소파에 앉아 TV를 보고 있던 용국의 무릎 위에 머리를 대고 소파에 드러누웠다.“힘들어~”“많이 바빴어?”“들어온 건 티 안 나도 나간 건 티가 난다더니. 윤이 나가니까 하필 오늘 또 무슨 날인지 단체손님도 많고 정신없었어.”“밥은?”“점심때 너무 바빠서 밥도 못 먹고 있다가 4시나 돼서 늦게 먹었더니 저녁 생각이 없네. 오늘은 그냥 굶을까봐. 여보는?”“아직 안 먹었는데, 라면이나 하나 끓여먹지 뭐.”“밥 먹어. 반찬 다 있는데 왜 라면을 먹어.”세진은 눈을 감고서 얘기했다.“매운 게 땡기네.”용국은 자기 무릎을 베고 눈을 꼭 감은 세진을 바라보다가 무슨 생각을 했는지 그녀의 머리 양 갈래를 양손에 각각 쥐었다. 그리고 머리카락을 그녀의 턱에 걸치게 하고 서로 반대편으로 감았다.“어휴, 세진이가 얼마나 힘들었는지 수염이 다 났네.”세진은 눈을 감은 그대로 웃음이 터져서 킥킥 대다가 벌떡 몸을 일으켜 앉았다.“아, 그러고 보니까 오늘 윤이랑 연락했어.”“뭐래?”“뭐 말이 통해야 말이지. 그, 메신저로 얘기하려니까 너무 답답해서 나 쉬는 날 만나자고 했어.”// 윤과 만나서 얘기한 세진.“오빠, 나 할 말 있는데...”“뭐?”“오늘 윤이랑 만났잖아. 얘기를 좀 했는데. 일은 하고 싶다는데 당장 집 구할 돈도 없나봐.”“처가(아내 부모님집 뭐라고 하는지 모름. 나중에 확인)에 같이 살기도 그럴 텐데... 불편한 게 한둘이 아닐걸, 음식 문제도 있고.”“그치? 그래서 내가 좀 얘길 해봤는데... 그 뭐야... 우리가 집 좀 구해주면 어떤가 해서...”용국은 빤히 세진을 쳐다보다가,“이미 그러기로 하고 온 거 아니야?” 라고 말했다.“...오빤 날 너무 잘 알아.”“첫 달만? 아님 계속?”“일단 4달만 일해주면 좋겠다고 했거든. 엄마랑 얘기한 거도 딱 그 정도면 바쁜 일은 끝나니까. 근데 뭐 우리 집 일 도와주는 거기도 하고... 내가 좀 아껴서 좀 계속 도와주면 어떨까 싶은데...”“월급 받을 때까지 한 달만 해줘도 될 거 같은데, 내 생각은.”세진은 몸을 배배 꼬았다. 용국은 눈을 게슴츠레 뜨더니,“하지만 이미 그렇게 말하셨겠지.”세진은 실실거리며 웃다가,“오늘 우리 외식할까?” 라며 화제를 돌렸다.“오늘만큼은 내가 먹고 싶은 거 먹어야겠네.”세진은 채비를 하라고 용국의 등을 떠밀며 보챘다.// 외식하러 나가서 대화. 음식 나오고 먹고 하는 묘사 추가.“나도 참 대단하다. 지도 식당에서 서빙이나 하는 주제에 오지랖이나 부리고. 참 정신머리 없는 년이야, 그지? 꼭 남편도 지 같은 거 만나서 부부 쌍으로 바보네. 우리 남편은 책을 많이 읽으면 똑똑해져야 되는데 어째 점점 더 바보가 되는 거 같애.”“어디서 일하는지가 뭐가 중요해. 그거 너랑 같이 일하는 사람들도 다 무시하는 말이잖아.”“네이, 알겠습니다~”“그리고 책이야 그냥 좋으니까 읽는 거지. 흥미도 있고, 또 번역할 때 도움 되기도 하고. 똑똑해지려고 읽는 건 아닌데 뭐. 바보면 어때, 좋아서 하는 일에 꼭 무슨 결과 같은 게 필요한 건 아니잖아. 우리가 그냥 서로가 좋아서 결혼한 거처럼.”“좋아서 결혼한 거 치곤 시큰둥한 말툰데?”“좋은 게 원래 그런 거지. 밋밋하고, 아무 냄새도 없고. 자극적인 건 곁에 계속 두면 꼭 싫어지는 때가 오거든.”용국은 말을 마치고 잠깐 뜸을 들이더니 덧붙여 말했다.“그래서 말인데 세진아. 이번에 윤 씨 그분 도와주기로 한 거, 어찌 되든 그냥 우리가 좋아서 한 일이라고 생각하자. 무슨 일이 생기든 간에. 우리가 좋아서 하는 일이야, 좋아서 하는 일은 대가를 바라지 않잖아. 혹시 결과가 나빠도 할 수 없어. 우리가 좋은 사람이라서 도와주는 게 아니야. 그냥 우리가 필요하기도 하고 원하기도 해서 그 사람들하고 일종의 거래를 하는거지. 그냥 그렇게 생각했으면 좋겠어, 어찌 되든.”“꼭 무슨 일이 생길 거처럼 얘기를 하네. 불안하게.”“만약이란 게 있으니까, 사람일 어찌 될지 아무도 모르고.”//세진의 소개로 그녀의 고향 시골에 일을 하러 간 윤과 윤의 남편, 세진과 용국이 그들이 지낼 집을 알아봐주고 도와줌.“작년에도 마늘 뽑으면서 태국 애들도 많이 데려다가 써봤는데, 이 태국 애들은 여자애들은 괜찮은데 남자들은 영 못 쓰겠어. 술만 처먹을 줄 알구.”용국이 숟가락을 딱 놓더니,“가만히 있는 한국남자 가슴도 뜨끔하네요.” 라고 답하자 세진의 어머니, 즉, 용국의 장모가 자지러진다.옆에서 또 거들어 얘기를 한다.“그런데 얘네들은 왜 이렇게 어른들한테 반말을 하냐?”용국은 다시 밥숟가락을 들다 말고 대답했다.“한국 사람들이 다들 자기한테 반말만 하니 반말만 배웠겠죠.”세진이 용국의 허벅지를 꼬집었다.“그렇지 않을까요? 허허.” 하며 용국은 멋쩍게 웃었다.//개통된 번호가 없어서 페이스북 메신저로만 연락이 되는 윤, 어른들이 스마트폰이 익숙치 않아 세진이 윤과의 연락을 담당하게 됨. 그리고 시골 어른들에게 윤과 그녀의 남편에 대한 불만 등을 접하며 윤에 대한 말투가 달라지기 시작하는 세진, 나중에 결국 도망간 윤과 남편 이야기세진은 어머니의 말을 듣고 골이 지끈 아프다. 그녀는 바로 메신저로 윤에게 통화를 걸었다.“윤, 남편 왜 일 안 나와?”“남편, 아파.”“남편 어제 또 술 마셨어?”“네.”세진은 이마를 짚는다.“윤도 일 못 나와?”“가.”“빨리 좀 갈 수 있어? 지금 밖에서 기다리고 있어.”“네.”//시골에서 세진에게 전화가 옴. 묘사 추가.“왜 무슨 일인데 그래?”“몰라. 윤이랑 남편 사는 집에 가봤는데 짐도 싹 빼고 없어졌대.”“말도 없이?”“어제는 일 좀 잘 해달라고 식당에 데려가서 고기랑 술도 원껏 먹였다는데, 지금 한바탕 난리지. 갑자기 일 할 사람이 없어졌으니. 진짜 이것들이... 도와준 은혜도 모르고.”“뭔가 사정이 있었겠지. 무슨 일인지 모르니까 나쁘게 말하진 말자.”“오빠는 가만 보면 걔네들 편만 든다?”“그렇잖아, 일이 너무 힘들어서 그랬을 수도 있고... 사람 다 똑같아. 나한테 힘든 건 남한테도 힘든 거지. 나도 그때 일 도와드릴 때 너무 덥고 허리도 아파서 솔직히 몇 번이나 도망가고 싶더라. 마누라 얼굴 생각하면서 참았지.”세진은 눈썹을 찌푸렸다.“우리 엄마 아빤 그 일 평생 하셨어.”“평생 해 오신 만큼 익숙한 부분이 있잖아. 처음 하는 사람한텐 더 힘들 수 있지. 아무튼 그게 중요한 게 아니라 일단 벌어진 일이니까 어떻게 대처할지 생각하자.”“어이구, 옳습니다. 참 똑똑하셔서 좋으시겠습니다. 아주 세상에서 제일 똑똑하시지. 그래, 오빠가 다 옳다. 항상 지가 제일 똑똑하지. 그렇게 똑똑한데 왜 돈은 많이 못 버나 몰라.”흥분해서 빠르게 말을 뱉은 세진은 즉시 후회스럽다. 눈살을 찌푸리고 그녀는 슬그머니 용국의 눈치를 보았으나 용국은 세진을 멀뚱히 쳐다보기만 했다.“미안. 방금 한 말 취소.”“뭐가?”“갑자기 흥분해서 말실수 했어. 미안해.”“진심으로 한 말 아닌 거 아니까 괜찮아.”“괜찮아. 화내도 돼. 근데 진짜 오빠 화내는 거 한번 보고 싶긴 하다.”“정말 보고 싶어?”“조금?”세진이 약간 흠칫했다.“나 사실 비밀이 있는데... 나 사실... 화나면 초록색 괴물로 변하는 체질이야.”“막 힘도 세지고? 아유, 무서워.”세진이 실소를 터트리며 손 사레를 쳤다.“아, 나는 지금 너무 화가 난다. 보여준다. 크앙!”용국은 소파에 앉아 있던 세진에게 달려들어 마구 간지럽혔다. 그들은 대소하며 뭍에서 엉킨 물고기처럼 엎치락뒤치락하다가 누가 먼저랄 것도 없이 서로를 원하여 사랑을 나눴다. 일을 마치고 그대로 함께 소파에 누워있던 두 남녀. 남자가 소파 한구석으로 밀려나 널브러져 있던 담요로 둘의 몸을 덮을 때 여자가 입을 열었다.“근데 진짜 궁금하다. 연애할 때는 솔직히 오빠 결혼하고 나면 좀 달라질 줄 알았거든? 연애할 때야 서로 좋은 모습만 보이려고 하니까... 진짜 결혼하게 되면 서로 싸우기도 하고... 울 엄마도 그렇게 말하고. 다들 그렇잖아. 근데 참 신기해?”말을 하다가 세진이 옆에 누워 있는 용국을 껴안으며 다시 말했다.“가끔은 감정 없는 사람처럼 느껴져서 좀 무섭기도 하고. 보통은 화내야 정상인 일에도 오빤 화 안 내잖아.”용국은 세진의 머리를 쓰다듬으며 말했다.“화낼 줄 모르는 사람이 어딨어.”“여깄지.”“나도 화가 날 때가 있지. 표를 잘 안 내서 그렇지.”“그러니까 보통은 그게 안 되잖아. 너무 막 화가 나면 흥분해서 막. 응?”“화를 내서 뭔가 해결될 만한 일이면 화를 내겠지. 근데 대부분 화를 내면 갈등이나 뭐 그런 게 악화되잖아. 그러니까 앞으로 뭐가 이득이 될지 판단하고 행동하는 거지.”“아니 그러니까, 그걸 어떻게 해. 어떻게 그렇게 절제를 잘 하셔?”용국은 잠깐 생각하는 듯 보이더니 세진을 마주 보게 옆으로 누으며 말했다.“예전에, 내가 한 열일곱 살쯤 됐었나, 나 동생이랑 한 번 심하게 싸운 적이 있었거든?”“뭐 땜에?”“그건 중요한 게 아니구, 아마 별 일 아니었을 거야. 아무튼 그렇게 한창 말싸움을 하는데 우연히 벽에 걸려 있던 거울에 내 모습이 딱 비치는 거야. 근데 거울 안에 보이는 그 사람이 너무 못나고 못 생겨 보이더라.”“그래서 어떻게 됐어?”“몰라, 그냥 그걸 딱 보고 충격을 받았는지 몸에 열이 확 빠져나가면서 좀 허탈해지는데, 싸우다가 딱 맥이 빠져서 할 말도 없고. 동생이 뭐라고 소리를 지르는데 들리지도 않고... 아마 그 이후부터 좀 그런 생각을 많이 했지. 내 옆에 항상 거울이 있는 거처럼 느껴지고. 그래서 거울에서 그 못난 사람 또 볼까 무섭기도 하고.”세진이 허공에 손을 휘저으며 말했다.“여기쯤 있나, 그 거울?”용국은 웃음이 터졌다. 그는 갑자기 세진의 엉덩이를 장난스레 꽉 쥐었다.“아니, 니 엉덩이 뒤에 있네. 세진이 엉덩이 다 보인다. 얼레리꼴레리.”//“그 윤 씨네 갑자기 없어져서 일손 부족하시잖아. 마침 나 일거리도 많지 않은데 내가 가서 도와드리지 뭐. 어쨌든 우리가 소개한 사람들이니까 죄송한 마음도 좀 들고.”“사람 사서 쓰면 되지.”“이참에 점수나 따지 뭐.”//윤이 살던 집주인이 세진에게 전화를 걸어 집을 청소해 놓으라고 화를 냄. 청소를 하러 세진과 용국이 집을 찾아감.“아유 냄새. 얘넨 뭐 이렇게 더럽게 살았대? 태국도 어지간한가 보다. 벌레들이 형님 하겠네. 뭔 소스를 주방에 천지로 발라놨네.”“옛날에 조선에 왔던 선교사들이 그랬다는데, 조선에 와서 가장 힘든 점이 조선인들의 불결함이었다고. 머리는 자르지도 않고 상투를 틀어서 잘 감지도 않지. 방에는 짚을 깔아 놓고 생활하는데 짚을 어떻게 청소해. 온갖 밥 먹다 튄 오물도 스미고 하다못해 애기 똥오줌도 좀 스몄을 것이고. 아무튼 그게 일상인 사람 기준에선 그걸 뭐 더럽다고 생각하나, 한국인도 다 예전엔 똑같았지 뭐. 지금의 우리가 우리 기준에서 남을 판단하는 거. 조금 다르게 생각해볼 필요도 있지 않을까요-오?”용국은 말을 마치며 세진의 눈치를 보곤 머쓱했는지 말꼬리를 올렸다.“헛소리 그만 하시고 청소나 하세요. 용국 씨? 더러운 게 더러운 거지.”코와 눈썹을 찡긋거리다 세진은 뭔가 생각난 듯 말했다.“나 가서 쓰레기봉투 좀 사올게. 여기 버릴 거 좀 다 정리하고 있어, 여보?”“아, 예. 입 다물고 청소나 하고 있겠습니다.”세진은 미소를 띠고 헬렐레 거리며 밖으로 나갔다. 그리고 다시 돌아왔을 때, 용국은 벽에 걸린 때 묻은 전신거울 앞에 가만히 서 있었다. 세진은 볼멘소리로,“아니, 청소 안 하고 뭐 해.” 라고 하자, 용국이 손짓을 하며 그녀를 부른다.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/novels/200413-거울_미완.html</link><guid

이야기]]></title><description><![CDATA[*수정이나 양자택일할 부분 [] 괄호 표시점을 보았다. 나는 일평생 점이니, 운수니 하는 것들을 한번 의존해 본 일 없이 없다. 참말 평생 이성을 신봉하며 살던 사람이 무슨 바람이 불어 그랬는가 하니, 중차대한 결심을 한 가지 한 까닭이다. 나는 올해 결혼을 할 것이다. 자기실현적 예언 따윌 은연중에 의도한 바도 없는데, 정말 뜬금없이 무엇을 근거로 이게 가능하다는 확신이 생겼는지 설명할 수가 없다. 그런데 정말 왠지 모르게 꼭 그렇게만 될 것 같다.올해 결혼을 하겠다고 전화로 부모님께 말씀드리니 아버지는 깜짝 놀라셨다. 날더러 늘 결혼을 안 한다더니 웬일이냐며 호들갑이셨다. 그러고는 모임에 나가면 당신 친구들이 손자 손녀 동영상을 보여주며 자랑할 때마다 쓸쓸한 기분이 들곤 했다 하시며, 연신 당신의 못난 아들 둘을 탓하셨다. 어머니는 만나는 여자가 있냐고 물으셨다. 없다고 했다. 그런데 무슨 결혼을 하냐고 다시 물으셨다. 그냥 그럴 것 같다고 답했다. 약속할 수 있는 거냐고 물으셨다. 그렇다고 답했다. 어머니는 약간은 의뭉스럽지만 또 기분이 좋은 걸 숨기지 못하는 말투로 또 여러 가지를 물어보셨다. 마지막으로는 진짜 올해 결혼할 수가 있냐고 물어보셨다. 그렇다고 답했다.나는 약속을 어기는 것이 싫어서, 또는 특별한 사정 때문에 약속을 못 지키게 되는 경우 등이 싫어서 약속 자체를 잘 하지 않는다. 그러므로 이번의 부모님과의 약속은 오랫동안 지켜온 나의 신념을 크게 위배하는 것이다. 그런데 이게 내게 이상하게 느껴지지가 않는다. 마치 올해 결혼을 하는 게 내게 무척 당연한 일로만 여겨진다. 정말로 나 자신도 이유를 알기 어려워 갸우뚱할 뿐이다. 어쨌든 부모님과 통화를 3월 말 즈음에 하고 4월로 달이 바뀔 때, 어머니께 전화가 와서 8개월 남았다는 통보를 받았다. 그럼에도 급한 기분이 들지 않는다. 정말로 나는 이미 결혼날짜도 잡고, 청첩장도 뿌리고, 예식장도 미리 다 예약하여 준비를 마친 사람처럼 굴었다. 어머니 말마따나 만나는 여자도 없는데.내 깜냥으로는 이 상황을 파악할 수 없어 점을 볼 생각이 들었다. 따지고 보면 그 전에는 그저 운세 따위를 점칠 필요를 못 느꼈던 것이지, 점이 사람을 홀리니 나쁘다거나, 비논리적이고, 무익한 것이라고 주장하거나 굳이 비판한 일 또한 없다. 점을 보는 행위 자체가 완전히 나의 일상과는 동떨어져 철저히 관계없는 일이었기 때문에 의식을 한 적이 없다. 점을 쳐본 일이 없다는 걸 보면 막연히 마음 한구석에 점 따위를 왜 보는지 통 모르겠다는 무의식적 단정만은 있었던 듯하다. 그런데 막상 점을 치고 점괘를 보고는 꽤나 놀라고 말았다. 이 점괘에서 표현된 내 성격이 나 자신과 몹시 닮았기 때문이다. 아무튼 나는 올해 결혼을 할 것이므로 배우자 사주를 보았다. 점괘는 다음과 같다.당신의 성격당신은 화(火)의 아이입니다. 불 중에서도 이글이글 타오르며 온 세상을 다 태울 듯 뜨거운 열기를 내뿜는 한여름 정오의 태양입니다. 그 마음 속에는 항상 불과 같은 열정이 내재되어 있으며, 두려움 없이 자신의 이상을 실현시켜 나가는 성질을 지닙니다. 다만 이것저것 가림 없이 모두 태워버리는 통에 소중한 것을 태워버리고 아쉬워할 수도 있겠습니다.또한 당신은 자존심이 강하며 독립심 또한 유별합니다. 작은 일에는 치밀하나 큰 일에는 겁이 없는 한편, 금전에 대해서는 한푼 모아 두푼식으로 꾸준히 모아간다는 재정 관념이 갖춰지지 않은 편이어서 돈이 잘 모이지 않습니다.배우자로서의 당신은 이런 사람당신은 배우자를 믿음직한 심복처럼 여깁니다. 무엇이든 궁리를 하기 좋아하는 본성을 지닌 터라 뭔가 신비롭고 파악이 잘 되지 않는 무게를 지닌 스타일의 여성에게 이끌리게 되며 그러한 여성을 아내로 맞이하여 아내가 조석으로 화장을 바꾸는 것보다는 자주 대화의 내용을 바꾸며 신선하게 대화를 이끄는 것에 더 큰 비중을 두며 지내고 싶어합니다. 아내를 내심 든든한 심복처럼 여겨 의논하고 기대고 싶어하는 마음이 기본적으로 깔려 있기 때문에, 아름다운 단세포 여성보다는 지적이고 다양한 관심사를 지닌 여인이 어울린다고 하겠습니다.당신의 배우자는 이런 사람자기 발전에 많은 가치를 두는 당신에게 배우자는 현실적인 문제로 가끔 유보를 원하기도 합니다. 연애는 아름다운 오해이고 결혼은 참혹한 이해라고 합니다. 그만큼 결혼은 당신의 바쁜 앞길에 웬만큼의 답보를 요구할 것입니다. 배우자와 당신은 서로의 발전을 원하면서도 무엇이 서로에게 도움이 되는 것인지를 간혹 잘못 짚어 어려운 때도 있을 것입니다. 하지만 긴 안목을 갖추어 본다면 배우자는 인생에 있어 가장 소중한 반려자입니다. 서로의 소중함을 조금만 일깨우고 노력하면 가장 적절한 답안은 물론 아름다운 사랑을 작성해 나갈 수 있을 것입니다.이게 어떻게 가능한 일인지 의문부터 들었다. 남들이 보기엔 중대한 결정을 정말 망설이지 않고 실행해버리는 성격이나, 지독하게 고지식하게 비출 정도로 내가 정말 옳지 않다고 생각하는 일에는 타협을 않는 성질머리, 또 재정 관념이 잘 갖추어지지 않았다는 것도 틀림이 없다. 연애를 할 적에 여자 친구에게 화장에 대해 비슷한 얘길 한 적도 있다. 실상 그냥 재미내지는 심심풀이 삼아 시작한 일인데, 문장 하나하나 구구절절이 나보다 나를 더 잘 아는 것처럼 쓰인 저 글들을 보니 살짝 소름마저 끼칠 지경이었다. 단 한 구절이라도 틀린 점이 있다면 그것을 이유로 점괘의 진실성을 의심했을 게 분명한데, 이래서는 도저히 명분이 없다.(사실 운세를 점치는 시도가 애초에 운세 따윈 믿을 게 못 된다는 자신의 믿음을 검증하려는 의미 같다.)나는 그러므로 다른 운세 사이트에 들어가서 교차검증을 진행했다. 그리고 그 다른 운세사이트에선 이런 결과를 내어 놓았다.미래 배우자의 얼굴둥근 계란형의 소유자 입니다. 보통체형이지만 볼륨감 있는 몸매의 여성이 되겠습니다. 길고 얇은 스타일이며 활동적인 성격의 소유자 입니다. 맑은 목소리로 자기 주장이 강한 여자입니다. 눈매가 촉촉하고 총명해 보여 맑은 인상을 주는 타입 입니다.미래 배우자의 성격얼굴부터 장난기가 가득한 사람입니다. 그 만큼 귀여운 행동도 많이 하고 어딜 가나 사랑 받는 막내 같은 사람입니다. 하지만 사랑 받는 것에만 익숙하기 때문에 다소 행동이 버릇 없어 보일 수도 있으나 보여지는 것과 의외로 여린 감성을 가지고 있어서 사소한 것에도 마음을 쉽게 다치기도 합니다.미래 배우자의 직업머리를 쓰기 보다는 전문적이고 기술적인 직종과 어울리는 사람입니다. 자신의 일을 누군가 간섭하는 것을 좋아하지 않으니 그만큼 자신의 일에 대한 능력을 쌓는 성향입니다. 하고자 하는 일에 망설임이 없으나 섬세하기도 하니 이와 관련된 직군의 사람을 가능성이 높습니다.미래배우자와의 연애요형결코 쉽지 않은 그를 연인으로 만들 방법은 단 하나. 칭찬입니다. 만인에게 인정받기보다 소중한 사람들에게 인정받기를 원하는 그에게 당신의 칭찬은 일편단심 보증서와 같으니까요. 한편 그는 장금이의 미각을 지녔으니 고백은 소문난 맛집에서 하는 것도 이색적일 것입니다.인연수귀하는 처궁이 위의 명식에서 붉게 표시된 일지궁 입니다.남자는 십성중에 정재나 편재가 아내성에 해당합니다.(정재와 편재를 합해서 재성이라고 합니다)사주상에 드러난 재성(妻星)은 정재가 1 개가 있고 편재가 1 개가 있군요지장간에 숨은 재성(妻星)은 없습니다.다음은 처성(妻星)의 희기(喜忌)를 보기로 합니다.乙 일간은(나 자신:日元) 오행이 목(木) 이므로 토(土)가 재성이 되고 사주에서 토(土)는기신 이 되겠습니다.다음은 처궁(妻宮)의 희기(喜忌)를 봅니다.처궁은 위의 명식에서 붉게 표시된 궁입니다.처궁은 희신 이군요.귀하의 사주에서 아내와 관계된 항목을 요약하면 아래표와 같습니다.애인 부부운전생에 나라를 구하거나, 덕을 많이 쌓아 배우자의 덕을 크게 볼 것입니다. 당신으로 하여금 가족까지 당신의 배우자를 통해 길한 운이 가정에 퍼지니 금전 및 건강운도 함께 들어와 복덩이가 넝쿨째 들어왔다고 할 수 있습니다. 혼자 돌던 바퀴가 이가 맞는 다른 바퀴를 만나 그 속도는 배가 될 것이니 하늘의 인연을 만나 행복합니다. 때론 서로 양보만을 하다가 결정하는 데에 어려움을 겪을 수 있으나 둘의 성격에 모나지 않은 탓에 큰 다툼이나 문제는 없을 것입니다. 복덩이를 안고 당연한 듯이 함부로 다루거나 소홀히 대하지 마십시오. 진심으로 대하여 사랑으로 다가가야 더 그 빛을 품고 자신의 날개를 펼치게 될 것입니다.이번 점괘는 차라리 내가 애당초 예상한 ‘점의 모호함’과 매우 흡사하였다. 말하자면 귀에 걸면 귀걸이 코에 걸면 코걸이라는 투로 표현 자체를 뭉뚱그려 놓았기 때문에 정확한 해석이 불가하다. 처음에 본 점괘와 일치하는 부분도, 그다지 일치하지 않는다고 볼 만한 부분도 찾기 어렵기 때문에 마찬가지로 이 두 가지 사례만 가지고 점괘의 효력을 짐작하기도 어렵다. 이 두 가지 점괘를 보고 갑자기 든 생각이 있다. 바로 점을 본 사람의 심리에 대해서다.만약 내가 이 점을 보지 않았다면 나는 내 배우자가 될 사람의 얼굴형이나 체형, 성격 등을 특정 짓지 않았을 것이다. 애초에 남에게 큰 관심을 두는 성격이 아니라 남의 얼굴을 자세히 들여다 본 일이 없지만, 이제는 만나게 되는 사람들의 얼굴형을 신경 쓸 것이 분명하다. 나는 내가 진실로 이 점괘들을 믿거나 믿지 않거나 관계없이 이미 점괘가 내린 판결에 구속이 되었다는 말이다. 원인은 두 번째 점괘의 마지막에 묘사된 ‘애인 부부운’이 몹시 좋기 때문이다. 만약에 이 점괘가 옳다면?나같이 잠재위험을 가급적 기피하고 실속을 챙기는 사람으로서는 논리적으로 설명하는 게 불가능한 이 점괘를 그대로 무시하는 게 어렵게 되었다. 세상 모든 일이 논리를 기반으로 작동하는 게 아니라는 것 또한 ‘이성적으로’ 이해하고 있기 때문이다. 종교를 주제로 다룰 때 주로 등장하게 되는 말이지만, 여기서 또한 통용될 것 같다.“맞다고 할 수 없지만, 그렇다고 틀리다고도 할 수 없다.”뭐, 긍정적인 효과를 굳이 유추하자면 그전의 모래알처럼 수많은 사람 중에 한 명이 내 배우자가 된다는 막연한 경우의 수보다는 그나마 해변 하나의 모래알 수 정도로 분명히 범위가 줄었다.그리고 바로 재밌는 상상을 했다.‘만약에 내가 마치 서로가 처음부터 한 짝이었던 것처럼 마음도 잘 맞고, 같이 시간을 보내는데 굳이 서로 눈치를 보지 않아도 일말의 불편함도 없는 사람을 만나서 결혼을 하기로 하였는데 그 사람의 얼굴이 둥근 계란형이 아니라면?’나는 바로 답을 유추할 수 있다. 이 경우라면 나는 즉시 점괘를 무시할 것이다. 근거가 부족한 점괘보다 나 자신의 느낌과 내게 그런 느낌을 주는 상대방을 더 믿을 것이기 때문이다. 점괘를 운명으로 치환해서 보자면, 운명을 따르는 것도, 따르지 않는 것도 양쪽 다 내게는 각각 다른 매력이 있는 길로만 여겨진다.그럼 또 바로 재밌는 상상이 든다.‘만약에 그렇게 결혼을 했는데 우리 부부가 정말 예측할 수 없는 불행들로 인해 삶이 궁핍하고 고달파진다면? 그리고 아무리 노력을 해도 나아지지 않는다면? 그때는 점괘를 따르지 않은 걸 후회하게 될까?’또 바로 답이 예상이 된다. 나를 만난 배우자야 모르겠지만, 나는 후회할 리가 없다. 애초에 점괘를 무시하기로 결정한 순간부터 점괘 자체를 머릿속에서 싹 지워버릴 것 같다. 나 자신이 어려움에 굴복하는 걸 치욕으로 여기는 까닭도 있고, 이제껏 내가 살아온 과정으로 증명된 나의 특이한 반항심을 고려하면 역시 그 어떤 일이 생긴들 내가 후회할 거란 생각을 할 수가 없다. 그간 내가 옳지 않다고 여긴 여러 가지 사건들에 저항해온 역사들이 조금 더 연장될 뿐이다. 아마 이 경우에는 운명이 내가 저항할 대상이 될 테다.운명이 마치 나를 고문하듯 괴롭히면서 나에게 후회를 하라 강요한들 죽는 한이 있어도 웃는 얼굴로 ‘아니오.’를 외칠 자신이 있다. 나의 배우자 또한 나를 믿었기 때문에 결혼을 한 것이 아닌가. 그런 사람을 배신한다는 건 상상할 수가 없다. 다른 이들에게 결혼이 어떤 의미인지 깊게 탐구한 일은 없지만, 적어도 내게 결혼이란 그런 의미이다. 한평생 서로를 믿겠다는 다짐과 약속이 현실의 제도, 풍습과 결합하여 나타난 형태의 결과물이란 것이다.일어나지도 않을 쓸모없는 상상을 이렇게 길게 하는 점과, 그리고 그 내용을 따져보면 첫 번째 점괘에 묘사된 나의 성격이 아주 꼭 들어맞다. 그러고 보면 어떤 성향의 사람이 어떤 사람에게 끌리는지는 이미 오랫동안 축적되어 온 결혼의 역사를 통해 짐작하기가 어렵지 않은 일로 보인다. 나처럼 별 쓸모없는 일(물론 이건 나에게는 쓸모 있는 일이지만, 다른 많은 사람들의 기준에서 쓸모없는 일이라는 얘기다. 내가 살면서 가장 많이 들은 말을 토대로 여기서 ‘쓸모없는 일’의 정의를 내리자면 ‘돈이 되지 않고’, ‘취직에 도움이 안 되고’, 혹은 ‘이성에게 매력적으로 보이기에 도움이 되지 않는’ 따위의 일 등이 그렇다.)에 궁리하기 좋아하는 사람이, 그저 외견만 아름답고(보편적 기준에서) 생각에 깊이가 없거나, 또는 속물인 사람에게 매력을 느낄 리는 없다. 결혼을 할 요인을 느끼기도 어렵다. 나는 이미 그 결혼생활이 어떻게 서서히 망조를 보일지 겪어보지 않아도 예측이 되기 때문이다. 한 가지 가능성이라면 성욕에 뇌가 마취가 되어서 아무런 판단을 못 하는 상태에서 관계를 가지고 우연히 아이가 생겨 버리는 경우가 있겠지만, 그것도 나 같은 성격을 가진 사람에게는 매우 힘든 일이다.(중학교 때 성교육을 받고 한 생각과 그 순서는 이렇다. 성관계시 피임을 제대로 하지 않으면 임신을 할 수 있다. 완벽하게 피임을 하는 것은 어렵다. 내가 만약에 누군갈 임신시켰을 경우, 내 성격을 미루어 보면 낙태를 하지도, 아이를 낳고 입양을 보내지도 못할 게 예상된다. 그러므로 결혼을 하고 싶지 않은 사람과는 성관계를 자제해야 한다.) 이렇게 생각하면 점은 단순히 못 믿을 것으로 치부하기 어렵다는 생각이 든다.위의 점괘들은 어떤 성격의 사람의 어떤 취향, 경향을 분석한 결과물일 수도 있다.(정확한 사실을 조사해 본 바 없으니 아마 이럴 것 같다고 예측만 할 뿐이다.) 다시 말하면 인간의 유형을 나누고, 어떤 유형의 사람이 어떻게 살아가는지 여러 사례들을 분석하여 가장 높은 확률의 결과를 ‘점괘’로 내놓는 것이다. 인간은 성장환경에 의해 몹시 변하지만 타고난 경향이 확고하다면 성장환경으로 인한 개개인의 차이는 좁혀질 수도 있다.나의 경우를 예로 들자면, 나는 어려서부터 세상을 바라보는 관점 자체가 특이한 편이었다. 이 때문에 오해를 산 적도 많고, 다른 사람들과 대화하기가 어려운 일(서로 동문서답을 하는)도 종종 있었다. 가령 초등학생 시절, 친구들이 H.O.T.(90년대 5인조 남성아이돌그룹) 노래 중에 뭘 제일 좋아하냐고 물었을 때, 나는 ‘빛’(‘강타’라는 멤버가 직접 작곡하고 부른 곡으로 알고 있다.)이라고 대답했다. 그런데 뜻밖에 나는 그 후 친구들이 모여 H.O.T. 멤버 중에 누가 제일인지를 가리는 토론(점잖게 표현했지만 사실은 말싸움)에서 강타를 옹호해야 하는 ‘강타파’에 강제로 편입되었다. 실제로는 나는 강타라는 사람에 대해 관심도 없고, 좋아하지도 않았다. 애초에 한 번도 연예인을 좋아해 본 일이 없다. 그 사람을 만나본 적도 없고, 만날 일도 없으며, 그 사람이 어떻게 살아가는지 알지도 못하는데 무엇을 보고 호감을 표할 수 있는지 알 수도 없었을 뿐더러 누가 제일인지 가려서 어쩌자는 건지 도무지 이해할 수가 없었다. 난 당초에 말 그대로 ‘빛’이라는 노래만 좋아했을 뿐이다. 지금도 음악을 듣는 걸 즐기지만 항상 노래와 가수는 내게 각각 별개의 존재이다.(박효신은 제외, 이 사람은 그냥 마음씨가 예쁜 게 너무 티가 난다. 이 말인즉슨, 박효신이 가수가 아니었어도 나는 박효신이라는 사람 자체에 호감을 느꼈을 거란 말이다.)이 별개의 존재라는 개념이 어릴 때부터 나의 가치판단의 근본이었다. 예를 들기 좋은 소재가 있다. 독서와 컴퓨터 게임 두 가지를 놓고 비교해보면, 일부 사람들은 독서는 유익하고 게임은 무익하고 시간 낭비라고 종종 말하지만 내 가치판단의 방식으로는 애초에 둘을 비교하지 않는다. 두 행위는 별개로 존재할 뿐이다. 무엇이 더 나은지 가릴 필요나 그 두 행위 간에 가치의 우위가 있다고 느끼지 못한다는 뜻이다. 마찬가지로 책을 많이 읽고 지식을 쌓은 사람과 게임을 많이 하는 사람 둘이 내 앞에 있다한들 비교하거나 우열을 정하지 않는다. 그냥 각각 별개의 사람으로만 인식할 뿐이다. 내가 만약에 자녀를 갖게 되도 책 읽는 걸 권장하거나, 혹은 자녀가 게임을 많이 한다고 꾸짖을 일도 없을 것이다.(실제로 어머니가 나를 이렇게 키우신 영향이 크다.) 그렇게 생각하게 될 수 있었던 이유를 아래 밝힌다.나는 내가 태어나 자라던 시골에서 소문난 독서광이었다. 어른들과 선생님들은 내가 책을 많이 읽는 걸 칭찬할 때가 많았다. 나는 단순히 하고 싶은 걸 할 뿐인데 칭찬을 듣는 건 정말 이상한 일이었다. 내가 책읽기를 즐긴 게 된 건 단순한 이유다. 책을 읽는 것을 내가 좋아하기 때문이다. 이게 무슨 말장난이냐는 반문을 받을 수 있다는 생각을 한다. 그러므로 이렇게 표현할 수밖에 없는 사유를 적는다.책을 읽는다는 행위는 내게 처음부터 공부를 잘하기 위해서, 혹은 좋은 학교에 가기 위해서 따위의 목적이 없는 단순한 놀이였다. 책읽기는 내가 세상에 태어나 처음으로 스스로 찾은 ‘좋아하는 놀이 1호’였다. 그렇게 된 이유는 또 간단하다. 내가 6살 때, 하루는 같은 동네에 살던 한 살 터울 사촌 누나가 유치원에서 한글을 공부해서 학교 앞에 세워진 안내판(학교 반경 200m 이내에 유흥업소 등의 영업을 할 수 없다는 안내 취지의)을 읽는 걸 보게 되었다. 나는 그게 몹시 시샘이 나서 사촌 누나가 읽는 걸 그대로 듣고 외워서 글자 하나하나 읽는 법을 혼자 익혔다. 그리고 어느 정도 자신감이 생기자 유치원에서 보육 교사분이 동화를 읽어주는 시간에 내가 대신 읽어주겠다며 나섰다. 자신감과는 다르게, 또 분하게도 어물어물하며 반도 제대로 읽지 못했다. 안내판에는 없던 모르는 글자가 많았기 때문이다. 그 후로는 계속 남들을 귀찮게 하면서 모르는 글자를 하나하나 익혀나갔다. 동화를 하나하나 더 읽을 수 있게 되는 과정이 무척 재밌었다.그리고 컴퓨터를 배우기 시작하면서 컴퓨터 게임의 존재를 알게 되었다. 나는 여기에 몹시 매료되었다. 처음에는 집에 컴퓨터가 없어 매일같이 남의 집에 놀러 가서 게임을 하거나 구경을 하곤 했다. 이후에 컴퓨터를 배우는데 썩 성과가 나오자 부모님은 내가 다니던 컴퓨터 학원에서 판매하던 컴퓨터를 한 대 사주셨다. 내 기쁨은 말로 형용할 수 없었다. 집에 컴퓨터가 생기자 한 번 매달리면 시간 가는 줄 모르고 게임을 하곤 했다. 그게 얼마나 집요했는지, 간혹 컴퓨터에 오류가 생겨 부팅이 안 되거나 하는 문제가 생기면, 컴퓨터 학원에 맡겨서 수리를 의뢰하는 그 시간조차 아까워서 어떻게든 직접 문제를 찾아내고 고칠 정도였다. 그 과정조차 모두 즐거웠다. 이 모든 게 내가 생각하는 내가 스스로 찾은 ‘좋아하는 놀이 2호’이다.첫 번째 놀이는 우연히도 어른들이 보시기에 마땅히 좋은 행동이었고, 두 번째 놀이는 그렇지 못하였다. 나는 똑같은 원인에서 비롯된 두 가지 행위에 상반된 평가가 이어지는 게 꽤나 놀라웠고, 내가 정말 좋아하는 것들을 남들이 함부로 평가하는 데에 맘속에서 적잖이 분노하였다.(혹시나 내 의견이 불편한 사람이 있을 것 같아 사족을 단다. 가치관은 서로 다른 게 당연한 일이고, 내가 가장 중요하게 여기는 것은 내가 정한 가치이다. 그리고 내가 정한 가치의 최우선순위는 행위나 생각의 당부당에 대한 내 자신의 판단 결과다. 내 어머니는 단지 나에게 바르게 자라는 걸 바라셨고, 난 그게 옳다고 판단하고 따르려고 노력했다.만약에 내가 게임 대신 사람들이 말하는 좀 더 건설적인 취미를 가졌다면, 공부를 더 했다면 내 인생이 더 나아졌을까? 따위의 생각을 해본 적도 없다. 마음이 즐거운 일을 했고, 여전히 마음이 즐겁다. 더 나은 인생이란 게 무엇인지도 모른다. 누군가 좋은 직업을 갖는 것이나, 권력이나 명예를 얻거나, 돈을 많이 벌고, 더 좋은 집에 살거나, 좋은 차를 모는 것이 더 좋은 인생이라 말한다면, 나는 그것도 참 옳은 의견이라고 답변하겠다. 그것도 존중받아야 할 누군가의 가치관이니까. 할 말이 많지만 사실 이 글은 그런 논의가 주된 목적이 아니기도 하고 나의 의식 수준이 다른 이들보다 높다고 생각지도 않기에 여기서 짧게 마친다.)이런 내 가치판단 방식과, 행동방식은 몹시 명확한 성향을 가졌다. 스스로 판단하고, 스스로 행동한다는 것이다. 첫 번째 점괘에서 묘사한 것과 일치한다. 또 이런 뚜렷한 성향을 가진 아이가 여러 명 있다고 가정했을 때 서로 그 과정은 다르겠지만 어느 정도 유사한 환경(특히 부모의 성향이 가장 중요한 것 같다.)에서 자란다면 성장한 후의 모습에는 서로 유사한 가치관을 가질 가능성이 충분히 클 것이다. 그리고 비슷한 생각을 하는 사람들은 비슷한 취향을 갖게 마련이 아닌가. 충분히 가능성 있는 일이라 여겨지는데 직접 확인을 해볼 수도, 실험을 할 수도 없는 일이라 아쉽다.나는 성향이 독특한 만큼 외모에 대한 취향도 독특한 편인데 내가 보통 예쁘다고 생각하는 얼굴이(얼굴에 착하다고 대놓고 쓰여 있는 얼굴), 내 친구들이 생각하는 예쁜 얼굴(특히 서양 미녀에 대해 의견이 극심하게 갈렸는데 나는 눈도 크고, 코도 크고, 입도 큰 그들의 얼굴이 좀 무섭다고 느낀다. 어디까지나 개인적인 의견이다.)과 종종 다른 걸 보면 성격이 외모 취향에도 영향을 준다는 가설 또한 세울 수 있다. 그럼 이건 관상과도 연결점이 있겠다는 생각이 든다. 그럼 배우자의 외모를 일러주는 점괘 또한 조금 수긍이 간다.그런데 점괘를 이렇게 ‘분석과 관찰의 결과물’로 여기자면 또 이해할 수 없는 일이 생긴다. 나는 점괘를 얻기 위해 내가 태어난 날과 이름만을 적었을 뿐인데, 그것에 따라 인간의 유형과 성격이 나뉜다는 것만은 도저히 믿을 수가 없다. 나와 한날한시에 태어나고 비슷한 이름을 가진 사람들은 높은 확률로 나와 비슷한 성격을 가지고, 비슷한 행보를 보이며 인생을 살고 있다는 말이 되기 때문이다. 생각이 더 뻗지 못하고 잠시 멈춘다.‘점’은 참으로 오묘한 것이구나! 감탄이 절로 나온다.[1번 결말 - 나는 갑자기 나와 한날한시에 태어난 남자들이 어떻게 살고 있는지 궁금해지기 시작했다. 그러나 이러한 궁금증은 잠시 뒤로 미뤄야 한다.나는 올해 결혼을 할 것이고, 장금이의 미각을 지닌 내 배우자의 입맛에 맞을만한 맛집을 미리 많이 알아두어야 하기 때문이다.둥근 얼굴형에 보통 몸매이며, 눈매가 촉촉하고, 얼굴에 장난기가 있으나 여린 감성을 지녔고, 지적이고, 관심사가 다양하고 활동적인 사람들이 어떤 음식을 좋아하는 경향이 있는지 알려주는 점이 없는 것이 아쉽다. 이것은 내가 후에 태어날 나 같은 별종들을 위해 꼭 정리해 놓도록 하겠다.아니, 그런데.나와 한날한시에 태어난 동명이인의 남자가 내 배우자 될 사람을 가로채 가면 어쩐다?][2번 결말 - 전에 근무하던 직장에서 매일 본인의 운세를 확인하던 직원분이 있었다.(가끔 내 운세도 같이 봐주셨다.) 요즘 세상에 그런 걸 매번 챙겨 보냐고 농처럼 말을 던진 기억이 난다. 그 분은 별다른 대꾸 없이 웃고 마셨지만, 사실은 점의 신묘하고 깊은 이치를 벌써 깨닫고 계셨고 우매하고 무지한 나의 질문에 굳이 대답을 할 필요조차 느끼지 못하셨던 건 아닐까.마치 내가 다른 사람들에게 ‘쓸데없는 일’로 보이는 일에 골몰할 때, 그 사람들이 내게 와서 왜 그런 걸 하냐고 물었던 것처럼.‘내가 나로 행복하게 살기 위해서’‘나의 소중한 시간을 내가 원하는 곳에 제대로 사용하고 싶어서’‘즐거우니까’‘남이 해준 맛있는 음식을 아무 생각 없이 먹는 것도 좋지만, 서툴고 모자란 솜씨로 재밌게 요리를 한 과정과 그 기억, 그렇게 완성된 맛없는 요리를 먹으면, 시간과 돈을 얼마나 썼는데! 하며 기가 막혀서 웃음이 터지곤 하는 일들이 내 머릿속 추억의 앨범 안에 차곡차곡 쌓여 더 오래 남을 기억이라는 걸 알아서’‘심심해서’‘다른 일을 접하는 게 내 사고의 폭을 넓힐 수 있으니까’‘소중한 사람들과 좀 더 기억에 남을 만한 추억을 남기고 싶어서’‘재밌어 보이니까’‘그냥 갑자기 그런 일이 하고 싶은 변덕이 들어서’내 진심을 그 사람들에게 표현해 본 일이 있었는지 모르겠다.그런 질문을 한다는 게 어차피 내 행동원리를 이해하지 못할 거란 반증일 텐데, 도무지 설득할 자신이 없어 그냥 미소나 짓지 않았을까.Anyway,[아무튼, 이라고 적는 게 나을지?]시간이 날 적에, 같이 근무하던 그 직원 분에게 연락을 해서 근황을 전해야겠다.올해 내 점괘가 아주 기가 막히다고,난 틀림없이 올해 결혼한다고.청첩장 곧 보내겠다고.]///////////////////////삭제1.이 두 가지 사례로 내가 배운 것이 있다. 하나는 마음이 진정 기꺼이 하는 일이라면, 그리고 옳다고 믿는 일이라면 세상 누가 그게 지루한 일이라고 훈수를 둔 들, 아니면 칭찬을 한 들, 혹은 무의미한 일이라 비판을 한들 개의치 않게 된다는 것이다. 나는 이러한 경험을 통해 처음으로 나 자신의 의견을 품게 되었고, 그게 설령 모두가 반대하는 의견이어도 무작정 휩쓸리지 않는 품성을 갖게 되었다. 나는 이것에 감사한다.////////////삭제2.그리고 둘째는 내 마음이 깊은 곳에서부터 정말 즐거운 경험을 하였다면, 설령 그 경험의 결과가 무의미한 것으로 끝난다 한들 후회하지 않는다는 것이다. 사람은 누구나 자신의 인생 밖에 살지 못한다. 나와 가장 친했던 친구의 말을 되새기게 된다. 그 친구는 한창 고시 공부 중이던 내게 그런 말을 곧잘 하곤 했다. 그렇게 인생을 즐기지 못하고 책상 앞에 틀어 박혀 있다가 혹시라도 비행기 사고라도, 차 사고라도 나서 죽게 되면 아깝지 않겠느냐고. 그렇지 않다고 답했다. 그저 그때는 어쩌다가 우연찮게 공부가 재밌었을 뿐이라고. 그런데 그보다 더 우연찮게 정말 그 공부는 완전히 무의미해 보이는 형태로 끝이 났다. 그리고 말도 안 되는 일이지만 그 무의미한 공부를 하던 나는 살고, 친구는 먼저 세상을 떠났다. 이건 여전히 아픈 일이다.//////삭제3.그런데 정말이지 친구의 의견을 그럴싸하다. 어차피 모두가 사형선고를 받고 태어난 죽음을 향해 달리는 인생이 아닌가. 모든 행동에는 근본이 중요하다. 근본이 바른 뿌리도 썩은 과실을 맺기도 하는데, 근본이 옳지 않은 행위는 어떠할 텐가?]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/essays/210403-점을-본-이야기.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Writings/Essays/210403 - 점을 본 이야기.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha

탓인지 몇몇 사람들이 자신이 태어난 나라를 ‘헬조선’이라 조롱하는 게 예사라는 것이었다. 그것이 사실이라면 몹시 슬픈 현실이었다. 누구의 잘못으로 멀쩡한 땅이 불과 3년만에 지옥이 돼 버린 건지 경위를 짐작할 수도 없을뿐더러 아니, 신이 아니고서야 멀쩡한 땅을 3년만에 지옥으로 만드는 게 가당한 일인가. 이것이 세월의 힘인지 참, 강산이 4년이면 변한다는 말이 참으로 헛된 말이 아니라는 생각을 했다. 어쨌든 나는 가진 재주가 없으니 그새 지옥으로 변모한 조국에서 살아갈 길이 막막하였다.아무튼 귀국을 하였는데 참 사람들이 지옥에 사는 것치고는 낯빛들이 좋다. 어느 누굴 보더라도 배곯은 기색도 없고 차라리 얼굴은 반질하니 기름기가 돌았으며 씩씩하게 걷는 것이 강제노역을 당하거나 형벌을 받고 있다는 기색을 찾아볼 수 없다. 이 모두가 잘 훈련된 배우들이고, 북한의 선전마냥 있지도 않은 것을 있다고 하거나, 억지로 수령의 은혜에 감동하여 불합리한 것을 기쁘게 감내하는 연기 따위를 하는 것이라면, 생각이 거기에 미치니 그것은 퍽 서글픈 일이겠다하며 공항을 빠져 나온다.집으로 돌아와 부모님의 일을 돕고 그렇게 시간을 조용히 흘려보냈다. 여기저기 다니며 그간 못 뵈었던 사람들을 만나기도 했으며, 책도 몇 권쯤 보았고, 시간이 날 적에는 그간 시간이 없다는 핑계로 미뤄온 게임도 하곤 했다. 아무튼 몇 달이면 사람을 적잖이 보기에 충분한 시간인데 나는 도무지 ‘헬조선’이란 말이 누구 입에서 나온 말인지 예상을 할 수 없다. 헬조선을 외치는 사람은 그렇게 온라인상에선 그리도 벌떼 같았건만 이것은 일부러 찾으려도 통 만나기가 어렵다. 5공시절의 분위기마냥 자신이 말한 ‘진실’이나 주변의 ‘고발’ 때문에 길을 나다니면 불시에 구속을 당하고 고문을 당할까 무서워 모조리 꽁꽁 숨어버린 것이 아니라면 나는 최소한 한 명의 진실된 발언자를 만났어야 앞뒤가 맞다.분명 공정하지 않은 사회다. 허나 이 나라 이 땅의 역사를 처음부터 다시 살펴보건대, 이만큼 공정한 사회는 과거에 단 한 번도 존재하지 않았다. 이건 비단 영웅 몇 명의 힘으로 일구어 낸 것이 아니다. 사회의 가치관은 사회에 살고 있는 사람들이 가진 가치관의 평균이다. 당신이 보다 공정하고]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/essays/행복론_미완.html</link><guid

쓰기, 생각하기]]></title><description><![CDATA[유독 게으르고 태만한 본성을 아직도 극복하지 못하여 영 운동 같은 건강한 습관은 갖지 못한 사람입니다. 그래서 꾀를 낸답시고 고육지책으로 생각한 게 바로 많이 걷기입니다. 많이 걷는 것이 건강에 도움이 된다는 사실이야 너무 뻔하고 심심한 얘기고, 걷는 행위 자체도 참으로 심심한 일입니다. 그러니 걷는 습관을 얘기하자면 이 글 또한 너무 심심해질 테니까, 어떻게 그 심심한 걷기를 이 게으른 사람이 꾸준히 할 수 있었는지를 설명 드리는게 낫지 않을까 싶습니다.결론부터 말하자면, 글을 쓰는 것입니다. 앞의 말속에 생략된 단어들을 이 뒤에 나열하면, 생각, 걷기, 상상 등이 있을 것입니다. 글을 쓰는 것이란 결국 단어와 단어의 조합이고, 앞에 나열된 단어들을 조합해보면 생각하며 걷기, 걸으면서 상상하기 등이 될 텐데요. 여기에 글을 쓰는 것이 또 합쳐지면 글을 쓰는 생각을 하면서 걷기, 상상에 대한 글을 쓰며 걷기, 그리고 지금 제가 하는 중인 걷기에 대한 글을 쓰기도 가능하겠네요.정말 참 쓸모없는 생각들이라고 생각이 드신다면 그도 옳습니다. 다만 글이라는 것은 공간이나 시간 등 조건의 제약과 관계없이 어디서든 할 수 있는 것이므로, 걷기에 접목될 수 있는 행위의 한 가지 좋은 예로 생각하시는 게 더 좋을 것 같습니다. 그리고 굳이 변을 하나 덧붙이자면, 글이란 것은 한밤의 어둠을 다 머금은 호수의 정적일 수도, 마음 한구석에 맥동하는 애틋한 감정일 수도, 그리고 이 모든 상상조차 한순간에 날려 버릴 만큼 강렬한 태풍일 수도 있는 것이니, 그 가변성과 다목적성만큼은 충분히 인정할 만하다고 생각합니다.아무튼 걷기 목표를 달성하기 위해 제가 하는 행동들은 앞서 설명 드린 제 생각과 글만큼이나 참 보잘것 없습니다. 다만 꾸준할 뿐이죠. 30분 이내의 거리는 걷기, 가급적이면 계단 이용하기, 차는 기본적으로 출퇴근용으로만, 식당은 직접 가서 먹기(배달은 종종 맛이 반감되기도 하죠.) 등등. 이 사소한 일들이 글을 쓰는 행위와 합쳐져서 꽤나 즐거운 일이기도 합니다. 그리고 즐거운 일은 억지로 하지 않아도 자연스럽게 하게 되죠. 제가 꾸준히 걷는 이유는 결국 글 쓰는 생각이 즐겁기 때문이겠네요.(리처드 탈러 분이 쓰신 ‘넛지’의 개념과 상당히 유사할 수 있다는 생각이 듭니다. 작년에 넛지:파이널 에디션이 출간되었으니 행동 경제학에 관심 있으신 분은 읽어보시는 걸 추천드립니다. 그리고 거기에 더해 책을 읽는 즐거움을 느끼셨다면 이랜텍 독서모임의 문은 항상 여러분을 향해 열려 있다는 사실을 주지해주시길 바랍니다.)유난히 날씨가 좋은 주말이었습니다. 토요일이라는 핑계로 실컷 늦잠을 자고 일어나서 밖을 나가봤더니 5월이 온 줄로 착각을 했죠. 그 햇볕이 마냥 좋아서 이유도 없이 한참을 산책했습니다만, 그 이유도 없는 산책 덕에 조금은 더 건강해지고, 내용이야 궁색할지언정 이런 글이라도 하나 남았으니 제 딴에는 썩 남는 장사란 생각이 듭니다.&nbsp;여러분은 이런 산책. 어떠신가요?_11 Mar

블로그에 쓰신 글의 링크였다. 아니, 정확히는 교수님의 어머니께서 쓰신 자서전의 일부였다. 그 글을 읽고 나서는 시간이 날 때마다 틈틈이 자서전의 나머지를 찾아 읽었다. 다 읽고 나니 2주가 지났다. 생각해보니 설 인사를 먼저 드렸어야 했는데 답장 하나 없이 글만 찾아 읽었으니 나도 참 버릇이 없다. 늦게나마 감사하다는 말과 함께 진심을 담은 소감을 전했다. 되려 고맙습니다 라는 답문이 와서 죄송스러운 맘이 들었다.&nbsp;남의 글을 평하는 재주가 없을 뿐 더러 평을 해야 하는 성격의 글도 아니고, 지식 또한 얕아 그 자서전의 내용을 축약하는 일은 하고 싶지 않다. 그냥 하나의 사람으로서 한 사람의 인생을 엿봤고, 자서전의 맺음과 함께 끝나지 않고 자손들로 이어진 ‘어머니’의 삶과 역사를 짐작이나 할 뿐이다. 그리고 곧바로 감출 수 없이 즐겁고 예쁜 기분이 드는 건 그 대물림이 얼마나 훌륭했는지 대변한다고 생각한다. 그저 글에서 훔쳐본 것이 다이지만, 그 어머니의 부모의 좋은 성품이, 그 어머니에게 전해지고, 또 그 어머니의 자손들로 전해진 것만은 자명하다. 큰 시련 또한 그 연속을 끊어내지 못했으니, 약한, 작디 작은 나약한 존재인 인간은 도대체 얼마나 강한 것인가.&nbsp;내 어머니는 글을 많이 남기신 편은 아니다. 어머니 사후에 책을 한 권 냈지만, 지면의 대부분이 소설이고 어머니 당신의 삶을 기술한 글은 거의 찾아볼 수가 없다. 실제로도 당신의 얘기를 입 밖에 꺼내는 일이 드물었다. 어머니의 어린 시절에 관한 얘기는 죄다 다른 사람의 입을 통해 들었을 뿐이다. 그중 하나 의문인 건 외삼촌에게 듣자 하니 학창시절에 공부를 그렇게 잘했다고 하던데, 그런 빌미를 꺼내어 공부에 통 관심을 안 보이던 본인의 아들을 자신과 비교하며 구박 한 번한 적 없는 사실이다. 아무튼 그런 혜택 아닌 혜택을 받고 자란 셈이니 그런 어머니의 아들로 태어나 자란 것은 참 해 볼만 한 일이었다. 군대를 두 번 가라면 못 가겠지만, 어머니의 아들로 두 번 태어나는 것만은 마다하지 않으리라.&nbsp;교수님께도 똑같은 말을 전했다. 제 어머니는 일찍 돌아가셔서 남기신 글이 적어 내내 아쉬웠는데 교수님은 참 무엇보다 값진 유산을 받으신 것 같아 부럽다고. 틀림없이 진심을 담은 말이었다. 내 어머니는 만 45세에 돌아가셨다. 그다지 짧지는 않은 생이며 할 얘기도 많을 텐데, 항상 글도 쓰셨는데, 너무나 아쉽고, 또 아쉬운 일이다.&nbsp;갑자기 글을 많이 써야 겠다는 생각이 들었다. 내 글이 얼마나 형편없고, 글에 담긴 생각이 얼마나 형편없고, 글을 쓰는 사람이 얼마나 형편없는지는 논외로 두더라도, 혹여 나 또한 언젠가 기적과 같이 결혼을 하게 되고 자손을 두게 된다면, 다른 무엇보다 내 형편없는 글들이 그들에게 더 가치 있는 유산이 되리라는 생각이 들었다. 막상 쓰려니 부끄러워서 잘 손에 잡히지는 않지만, 첫술에 배부를 수 있을까. 언젠가 쓰다 보면 하나쯤 쓸 만한 것이 나오겠거니 배부른 희망을 가져 본다.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/essays/210228-인격읽기.html</link><guid

것 같았다]]></title><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;설에 고향을 찾아가던 길, 한가롭게 국도를 타고 느긋하게 차를 몰았다. 충남 아산에서 강원 양구까지는 세 시간 내지 네 시간이 걸리는 먼 길이건만 본체 느긋한 성격이라 느릿느릿한 귀경길이 그다지 따분하지 않았다. 예전에 보았던 풍경을 다시 보는 것이 새로웠다. 라디오에서 듣는 사람들의 각양각색의 사연도 좋다. 매년 반복되곤 하지만, 이즈음의 라디오 사연 중에는 취직이나 결혼을 하라는 친인척들의 잔소리에 대한 푸념이 많다. 그런 흔한 스트레스를 받아본 적 없는 입장으로서는 가족들에게 감사한 맘이&nbsp;들 뿐이었다.&nbsp;아니면 나 자신이 통 무신경하여 그런 잔소리를 신경 쓰거나 기억해본 일이 없던가, 뭐 이것은 어찌 되었든 상관없는 일이니 기왕이면 가족의 공으로 두는 편이 낫겠다.&nbsp;고속도로를 달리는 게 아닌지라 표지판을 수도 없이 마주하였다. 은근히 표지판에 쓰인 지명의 유례를 추측하고 머리를 굴리다 보면 지루할 틈이 없다. 가령 며느리고개라는 지명을 표지판에서 보게 되면 나는 긍정적인 생각이&nbsp;떠오르기보다는&nbsp;대번에 옛적 또 어느 집 어떤 며느리가 저기서 또 고생을 한 사연이 있나 생각하기도 하고, 그러나 곧 나는 하기야 예전이야 고생한 며느리들이 한둘일까 보냐며 셈하는 게 금세 질려 버리기도 했다. 하긴 그 질려 버린 인간조차 이번 설에는 사람이 많이 오지 않아 일손이 부족하니 전을 부치러 일찍 가겠다며 다짐한 걸 못 지키고 한껏&nbsp;풍경 놀음을&nbsp;하고 있으니, 공평한 사회란 건 참으로 오기가 어려운 것이다. 그러니까 이것은 표지판에서 시작해 공평한 사회에 대한 생각으로 끝난 어떤 얘기인 듯한데, 어떻게 쌀을 축내는 한 인간으로 태어나 이런 시시한 생각들을 끊이지 않고 할 수 있는 것인지 스스로도 참 놀라울 지경이었다. 놀랍고 어처구니가 없지만 때론 자못&nbsp;나&nbsp;자신을 대견하게 생각하는 바가 있으니 그 이유는 나이를 먹고 경험이 쌓여 일면 생각과 의식이 고착화되고 편견이 쌓일 법도 한데&nbsp;머릿속엔&nbsp;항상 흐르는 물처럼 생각이 멈추지 않는다는 점이다. 아니, 생각이 많은 사람들이 곧잘 우유부단하게 굴 듯 사실은 대견하다는 말은 거짓이며 나는 이런 버릇을 술을 먹기 위한 핑계로만 사용하고 있을 뿐이다. 그러니까 나의 수많은 치부 중에&nbsp;한 가지&nbsp;정도가 될는지. 혼자 이런저런 실없는 생각을 하며 풍치 있는 도로를 달렸다. 적어도 몇 번은 오고 갔을 길 옆의 산 중턱에 못 다 자란 소나무가 보였다. 어째 저번보다 조금은 더 나무가 자란 것 같았다.&nbsp;점심때가&nbsp;조금 지나 좋아하는 막국수집에 들러 점심을 먹고 큰집에 도착했다.코로나 바이러스가 창궐한 탓으로 이번 설은 오지 않은 친척들이 많았다. 나 또한 주변을 의식해 이렇게 오는 게 꺼림칙하긴 했으나, 설 제사상에 내 친어머니의 제사도 함께 지내는 탓에 오지 않기가 어렵다. 커피 한잔을 마시며 근황 따위를 큰아버지와 얘기하다가 잠시 본가로 가 부모님을 뵙고 쉬다가 저녁이 돼 서야 다시 큰집에 내려왔다.저녁 때는 술판이 벌어졌다. 게으른 아들 대신 전을 다 부쳐 놓은 어머니와 술을 한 잔, 아니 정확히는 친척들이 모여 저녁을 먹고 술잔을 돌리는 와중에, 그 전을 다 부친 우리 불쌍한 어머니는 매일같이 술을 마시는 못난 아들을 보시며 잔소리 아닌 잔소리를 하셨다. 술을 좀 줄이라는 어머니의 걱정이 무언지 잘 알면서도 나는 매번 똑같은 대답을 내어 놓을 수밖에 없었다. 내가 밤에 잠에 들려고 노력하여도 생각이 좀처럼 자력으로 멈추지 않는다는 말을 하면 무슨 생각을 하냐는 물음을 재차 받는다. 그럼 나는 멋쩍고 할 말이 없어 토론 같은 것을 한다고 답한다. 어머니는 무슨 토론할 것이 그리 많냐며 삐쭉이시고는 마치 복습을 시키는 선생님처럼 매번 똑같은 말을 하신다.&nbsp;‘야한 생각을 하라.’이것은 내가 수년간 풀지 못한 난제 중의 하나이다. 난 어떻게 야한 생각이 사람을 꿈나라로 오게끔 유도할 수 있는지 도통 갈피를 잡을 수&nbsp;없을 뿐더러,&nbsp;설령 그것이 가능하다 치더라도 그 미래에, 즉 야한 생각을 해서 잠이 잘 들게 된 연후에, 도리어 야한 생각이 어떻게 사람을 잠들게 할 수 있는지 그 인과가 미칠 듯 궁금하여 오히려 잠을 이루지 못하게 될 거라는 확신이 있다. 그리고 그 해답을 못 찾고 불면증에 시달릴 자신 또한 있다. 더불어 야한 생각을 하자면 사람의 상상력의 한계로 말미암아 결국에는 언젠가 누군가를 내 머리 안에 소환하게 될 것인데, 이를 상대방의&nbsp;동의 없이&nbsp;하는 일은 영 마뜩잖은 일이다. 불과 상상이라 할 지라도 타의로 발가벗겨진다는 건 오죽 불쾌한 일일까. 그리고 또 시간이 아깝다. 그런 생각을 할 시간에 공평한 사회를 조금이라도 더 탐구한다면 어쩌면&nbsp;또 다른&nbsp;며느리고개가 생기는 일은 막을 수 있지는 않을는지! 그러니까 결론은 이렇게 길게 설명하기도 우스운 얘기지만, 말하자면 나는 입으로만 일하는 사람보다 한 술 더 뜬, 생각으로만 일하는 사람인 셈이다.&nbsp;아무튼 이런 요상 망측한 이야기의 주인공인, 잠을 잘 못 자는 한 사람은 고향집에서 그동안 못 잔 잠을 다 몰아 잤다. 그전엔 입맛이 없다며 먹는 건지 마는 건지 했던 밥도 몰아서 다 먹은 듯하다. 막국수는 기어이 한 번을 더 먹고 왔다.&nbsp;아산의 집으로 돌아오는 중 다시금 본 그 나무는&nbsp;며칠 사이&nbsp;더 자란 건지 아닌 건지 알 방도가 없었다.&nbsp;허나&nbsp;그, 대단한, 공평한 사회를 생각하는 사람은 틀림없이 체중이 2kg 늘었다는 것을 밝힌다.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/essays/210220-나무가-자란-것-같았다.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Writings/Essays/210220 - 나무가 자란 것

들었을까]]></title><description><![CDATA[직장을 얻어 출가하여 그저 저렴한 중에 깨끗한 방을 구해서 지냈다. 이 작은 방안에 행복은 얼마나 들었는지 궁금해져 헤아려 본다. 이따금 노을이 나보다 먼저 방안에 들어와서 나를 반긴다. 그럴 때면 몹시 행복한 기분이 든다. 작은 TV 하나, 게임하기에 충분히 좋은 컴퓨터, (읽지 않고 내팽개쳐진) 책 몇 권 등등은 그저 거기에 있기만 해도 기분이 좋다. 눈을 뜨면 컴퓨터를 켜고 음악부터 튼다. 치즈(CHEEZE)의 Mood Indigo와 함께 시작하면 완벽한 하루를 보낼 준비 완료! 작은 방이니 만큼 청소하기가 간편하다. 청소를 자주 하는 편이다. 비록 내 집은 아니나 계약기간 동안만큼은 내가 주인인 셈이다. 엔트로피는 항시 증가한다고 했으므로 물건이든 사람과의 관계이든, 뭐든 잘 닦고 빛내주어야 하고 그게 주인 된 자의 도리라고 생각한다. 그러고 보니 대학을 다니던 시절, 학교 본관에서 창문을 청소해주시던 분과 한 대화가 기억이 난다. 내가 보기에 유리로 된 창문이 너무나 많고 끝이 없어 그분께 안 힘드시냐고 말을 붙였더니 이분이 대답하시기를 마음을 닦는다는 생각으로 하면 괜찮다고 하셨다. 그 대답이 꽤나 인상적이라 기억에 남는다. 하여튼 나는 마음을 닦는 경지에는 못 올랐더라도 깔끔한 환경에서 지내면 몸과 마음도 건강해지고, 집의 소유주는 임차인이 집을 잘 관리해주면 기분이 좋을 것이니 서로 남기만 하는 장사다. 시간이 날 적에 커피 한잔을 마시는 것이 좋다. 커피를 자주 마시고 좋아하는 탓에 커피머신, 밀크 프로더를 사고픈 욕심이 있지만 이미 집이 좁다. 믹스커피 한 스틱도 내 맘에 충분히 족하다. 호주에서 다닌 학교에서 받은 컵이 있는데 벌써 3년 넘게 애용 중이다. 이게 참 앙증맞고 귀엽다. 여기에 믹스커피를 타 먹거나, 물을 마시거나 하면서 매일 뽀뽀를 하면 왠지 커피가 더 맛있는 느낌이 든다.(소주도 이 컵에 따라 마신다.) 공기 좋은 호주에서 지내다가 한국에 와 보니 미세먼지가 참 많다. 환기를 해도 자주 먼지청소를 해줘야 한다. 공기청정기를 사다 놓고 이따금 돌린다. 세상 참 좋아졌다. 이따금 기계가 돌아가는 것을 보며(담배를 피우고 들어오면 기가 막히게 알아채고 돌아간다. 흡연자로서 부끄럽다.) 공기가 맑아진다고 생각하면 호주 블루마운틴에서 마셨던 공기가 떠올라(물론 기분 탓) 기분이 절로 좋아진다. 집 뒤편에는 우사가 있다. 가끔 환기를 한다고 창문을 열어 놓으면 소똥 냄새가 달려든다. 강원도의 고향집을 떠올리게 하여 마음이 푸근해진다. 아침이면 새 지저귀는 소리가 들리고, 밤 10시가 되면 어김없이 윗집 코 고는 소리가 들린다. 하루 또 열심히 사셨구나 하는 생각이 들어 그 소리가 귀엽고, 경건하게만 느껴진다. 나도 하루를 또 열심히 살았다. 그렇게 생각하면 보람이 있다. 화장실에 창문이 없어 자주 청소를 해줘야 한다. 문을 닫아 놓으면 물때가 많이 끼는 편이다. 샤워를 할 때마다 한 군데씩 청소를 해준다. 샤워를 하면서 운동도 하니 일석이조다. 부엌은 혼자 쓰기 딱 알맞다. 요리를 자주 하는 편은 아니라 조리도구들은 딱 알맞게만 가지고 있다. 요새는 작은 방에서 자취하는 사람들이 많다 보니 그런 사람들을 타겟으로 한 여러 아이디어 상품들이 많다. 가끔 필요한 게 있으면 그냥 물건을 사기에 앞서 혹시 기발한 상품이 있지 않을까 인터넷을 뒤져 구경하곤 한다. 가끔 그렇게 한참 아이쇼핑을 하는 게 즐겁다. 호주에서 지낼 때 다이슨 청소기를 하나 구매해서 사용했었다. 청소기의 성능도 좋고 소리도 경쾌해서 즐겁게 청소를 하곤 했다. 귀국을 하면서 처분한 뒤로 이따금 그 생각이 나 아쉬운 맘이 들었는데 요새는 중국 제품 또한 좋다고 하여 시험하는 셈 샤오미 무선청소기를 하나 구매하였다. 중국의 기술 발전이 실감된다. 구매한 제품은 디자인도 예쁘고, 성능 또한 훌륭하다. 사기를 잘했다고 생각한다. 청소가 조금 더 즐겁고 편해졌다. 침대 협탁에 고정할 수 있는 스마트폰 거치대를 하나 사서 사용한다. JB-lab이라는 회사의 제품인데 사고 보니 내 자동차 무선 충전 거치대도 이 회사 제품이었다. 아무튼 이 거치대는 무려 무선 충전도 같이 된다. 자기 전에 웹툰을 보거나 유튜브를 시청하거나, 글을 읽거나 할 때 바로 누워 볼 수 있어 참으로 편리하다. 술을 자주 먹는 탓에 늦잠을 잘 때가 있는데 바로 눈앞에서 알람이 울리니 안 일어나고는 배길 재주가 없다. 가끔 스마트폰을 만지작거리다가 잠들어서 충전을 못 시키는 경우도 있었는데 그럴 걱정도 사라졌다.(광고는 아니다.) 이런 기발한 물건을 구할 때면 물건은 자꾸 발전하는데 나는 통 발전이 없는 거처럼 느껴질 때가 있다. 나에게 향상심을 일깨워주니 비록 말은 못 해도 나의 좋은 친구인 셈이다. 내 친구가 고장이 나지 않고 오래 버텨주기를 기대한다. 남자 혼자 사는 집은 으레 ‘홀애비 냄새’가 난다고 하여 방향제를 항상 구비하여 둔다. 찾아오는 손님이 있어서가 아니라 내가 그 홀애비 냄새에 적응하여 나중에는 맡지 못하는 게 무서운 이유다. Cotton Candy향을 좋아해서 Little tree라는 미국 제품을 쓰곤 했는데 최근에 내 취향에 딱 맞는 블랙체리향의 디퓨저를 발견했다. 어쩌다 돈을 얻은 것보다 몇 배는 기쁘다. 퇴근하여 집에 돌아와서 문을 열 때 신선한 향이 나 매번 기분이 상쾌하고 좋다. 화장실에 들어가면 매일 거울로 마주하는 사람은 인물이 썩 훌륭한 건 아니라도 웃음에 어둠이 하나도 없는 것이 보기 좋다. 그전에는 너무나 행복하게 웃는 사람들을 보면 저 사람들은 인생에 참 즐거운 일들만 있는가 보다 싶었는데(질시였을지 모른다.), 오히려 맑은 웃음을 가지고 있는 사람들이 속으로는 근심을 많이 겪어왔던 경우가 많다는 걸 나중에 알게 됐다. 가끔 그런 생각을 하던 어리석은 때를 떠올리며 거울을 보며 피식 웃곤 한다. 예나 지금이나 그 거울의 사람은 나의 좋은 친구이다. 일 년 반 남짓 머문 집인데 본사 발령으로 이사를 갈 때가 되어 이전에 써놓은 글에 마지막 항목을 덧붙인다. 다음번 주인에게 이 작고 귀여운 방이 잘 인도되기를 바란다. 집에는 그곳에 사는 사람의 기운이 깃든다고들 하는데, 부디 나에게도 좋은 기운이 있다면 이곳에 남고, 나의 나쁜 기운은 나와 함께 가기를 바란다. ]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/essays/200424-10평짜리-방-한-칸에-행복은-얼마나-들었을까.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Writings/Essays/200424 - 10평짜리 방 한 칸에 행복은 얼마나 들었을까.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 10:32:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[180920 - 숨바꼭질]]></title><description><![CDATA[&nbsp;이른 새벽에 전화가 울리는 걸, 발신자만 확인하고 도로 잤다. 으레 남이 곤히 자고 있을 시간에 전화를 해서 외로움을 토로하는 녀석이었다. 이만한 민폐가 없었다.&nbsp;아침에 눈을 떠서 전화를 걸었다. 엉뚱하게도 H의 친구 E가 대신 전화를 받았다. 무슨 말을, 말을 했더랬다. 나는&nbsp;앉은자리에서&nbsp;벼락을 맞았다.

The most controversial animal testing is the test that particularly includes testing of medicines for research and biological reproduction. As much as animal testing is controversial, there are justifiable reasons supporting animal testing. Of course, clinical trials are not only negatives.
in the manufacturing of drugs that allows pharmaceutical companies to get drugs onto the marker safer and faster. For example, ‘Pasteur’s experiments’ produced vaccines for children, such as measles, which are dangerous for children because of inoculation of rabies.
When it is turned out that only 1.16% of diseases are common to both human and animal, however, the controversy arose due to not only the ethics of animal testing but also its effectiveness.
In 1957, ‘Talido maideu’ was the main ingredient of a medicine called ‘Kontereu’, produced by a German pharmaceutical company. The drug showed excellent efficacy with sedation or sleeping pills, especially when the pregnant women developed her pregnancy symptoms. There were numerous animal experiments that were conducted at the time of the drug, and then marketed at the time of being declared ‘harmless’ in animal testing, but in 1962, there were tens of thousands of deformed babies and thousands of deaths worldwide. Later, many pharmaceutical companies experimented with mice, rabbits, and primates to simulate the side effects of ‘tallidomaideu’, but when injected with very high concentrations of 75 to 300 times of the drug was injected, particularly in the New Zealand white rabbit, which was able to reproduce its side effects. This shows inefficient side effects that could not only be seen in animals, but only humans.
Secondly, it is unethical to confine an animal’s life to a laboratory and to live a life of pain. Some experiments involve cruel drug experimentation such as drug abuse, strangulation, and others are subjected to cruel experiments. Euthanasia is also being carried out after animal testing. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (UDOA) in 2010, 97,123 animals suffered during the trial without anesthesia. Despite the fact that real animals and humans share only 1.16 percent of the population, we are committed to doing so.
Lastly, there are new technologies that can replace animal testing because of advances in science. There are many different technologies, such as ‘INVITO’, which breeds and research cells in ‘PETRIO’ dishes, which are more efficient than animal tests because of human cells. They can also obtain blood samples obtained from humans and study blood samples, and also can be experimented with commercially available, such as ‘EPIDEM’ and ‘THINCET’. In addition, using computer simulations, one can conduct research without experiments on biology.
In conclusion, we should be reminded that animal testing is wasteful inaccurate and unethical and scientists and pharmaceutical companies should looking at the new alternatives that are being developed before resorting to animal testing.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/writings/essays/170615-animal-test.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Writings/Essays/170615 - Animal Test.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 10:17:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Portfolio_Kor]]></title><description><![CDATA[

🖐️ 안녕하세요. 데이터 분석과 IT 기술을 통해 혁신을 추구하는 공정기술 엔지니어 박양하입니다. 저는 그동안, 문과 출신 엔지니어라는 약점에도 불구하고, 끊임없는 학습과 고민으로 회사의 공정과 품질을 꾸준히 개선해왔습니다.
신뢰할 수 있는 데이터를 수집할 수 있는 기반을 마련하고, 축적한 데이터를 올바르게 분석하여 회사의 방향성을 제시하고, 문제를 해결할 수 있는 근거를 만들어 나갑니다.
오랜 현장 경험을 통해 문제를 직관적으로 파악할 수 있는 능력을 갖추었다고 자부합니다. 숫자와 데이터에만 매몰되지 않고, 보이지 않는 ‘실제 문제’를 파악하기 위해 항상 합리적인 회의주의를 가지고 업무에 임합니다. <img alt="Pasted image 20241204183153.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/settings/attachments/pasted-image-20241204183153.png" target="_self" style="width: 500px; max-width: 100%;">”측정되지 않는 것은 관리되지 않는다고 가정하는 건 잘못 됐다. 그건 값비싼 신화다.” - W. Edwards Deming
아래에는 제가 실무에서 공정과 품질을 개선하기 위해 사용한 IT기술들과 제가 담당하거나 기획했던 프로젝트를 간단히 소개 드리겠습니다. 귀한 시간을 내주셔서 정말 감사합니다!

Add a link up to your home note, or "personal retreat" note or "life compass" note or similar. This epic life audit is a powerful way to gain perspective on your life and realign your efforts to live with more meaning and intention.
What you need. A private place.
A thinking space. Prepare yourself beforehand. Ideally a few days prior, just start thinking loosely about where you are in life and how things are going. Budget 2-3 hours of private, uninterrupted time. Or 3 time blocks of 30-45 minutes. Result you'll say afterwards: I know exactly where I am, I know how I got here, and I know where I would like to go. Result you'll feel afterwards: Deeply knowing whatever it is you care about, and how you want to move forward. How to go through it: Don't score based on outcomes, but on alignment.
From the bottom...up! Reasoning for Overall Score Two hours later, your final reflections will go here. Next actions and takeaways Try to give yourself 4-8 high-level actions and takeaways. Below is an example:
Live a lifestyle with movement &amp; vitality: Significantly change my current lifestyle from a sedentary one, back to one with movement and vitality.

Answer: The assembly instructions are currently only available in Korean. We recognize the importance of making these accessible to our team in China and plan to have them translated into English as an intermediary step. This process is expected to take approximately one week. We will explore options for translation into Chinese to ensure clarity and accessibility for all team members involved in the assembly process. Question: Do we have visual aids, such as videos, to supplement the assembly instructions? Answer: At the moment, we do not have video documentation of the assembly process. However, we acknowledge the value of visual aids in enhancing understanding and reducing the potential for errors. We will initiate the creation of video tutorials that detail the assembly process, ensuring that these resources are comprehensive and easy to follow. Question: What specific assembly procedures are currently undertaken by the Korean CM, and are we fully aware of these processes? Answer: The Korean CM handles a range of assembly procedures that are documented in our standard operating procedures. However, it's essential to conduct a thorough review to ensure that all processes are fully captured and up-to-date. We are in the process of auditing these procedures to confirm their completeness and accuracy. Question: Considering the assembly procedures performed by the Korean CM, do we believe it's feasible to replicate these processes in China without significant obstacles? Answer: Based on our initial assessment, we believe that transitioning these assembly processes to China is feasible. The procedures do not require specialized skills that cannot be replicated or taught in China. However, we must ensure that all procedural documentation is current, translated, and adapted as necessary to meet any local regulatory requirements or operational differences. Question: Are there any anticipated challenges or limitations in transferring the assembly line to China, such as differences in regulations, standards, or workforce skills? Answer: While we anticipate a smooth transition overall, we are mindful of potential challenges such as differences in regulatory standards, the need for workforce training, and the adaptation of procedures to local practices. We are committed to conducting a detailed analysis to identify any such challenges early in the process and develop strategies to address them effectively. Question: What will be the approach if there are questions raised during the meeting that cannot be immediately answered? Answer: Should any questions arise that I cannot answer directly, I will take detailed notes and follow up with my direct manager to ensure a timely and accurate response. We are committed to transparency and effective communication throughout this transition process. Question: Do we need to translate the assembly instructions? Are there videos? Answer: Yes, the instructions are only in Korean now. We need to translate them into English, which will take about a week. We don't have videos yet, but we plan to make them to help everyone understand the process better. Question: Can we use the same assembly procedures in China as in Korea? Answer: The procedures we use in Korea can be used in China too. We don't see big problems with moving the assembly there. Most tasks don't need special skills. But, we need to update and translate our instructions to make sure everyone can follow them. Question: What problems might we face moving to China? Answer: We might face some challenges, like different rules or the need to train the team in China. But we believe we can handle these by planning well and updating our instructions. Question: How long will it take to get all the documentation ready for the China team? Answer: We need about one week to translate the current documents into English. Making videos and further translations might take a bit more time. Question: Will the training materials be understandable for someone who doesn't speak Korean? Answer: Yes, we will translate everything into English first, and then into Chinese if needed, to make sure everyone can understand. Question: How do we ensure the quality of the assembly process remains high after moving to China? Answer: We will train the China team using our updated guides and videos. We will also check the assembly quality regularly. Question: Are there any parts of the assembly that must stay in Korea? Answer: Right now, we think everything can move to China. But we will double-check to make sure. Question: What is our timeline for moving the assembly line to China? Answer: We are still planning, but we will share a timeline as soon as we have it. Question: How will we handle differences in work culture between Korea and China? Answer: We will learn about the work culture in China and adapt our training and management to fit well with the team there. Question: Do we need any special permissions or certifications to start manufacturing in China? Answer: We are checking on this. We will get all the needed permissions and certifications before we start. Question: How will we transfer equipment and materials to China? Answer: We are planning the best way to do this. We will make sure everything is safe and cost-effective. Question: What if we face unexpected challenges during the move? Answer: We will plan carefully and have backup plans. We will solve problems as they come. Question: How will we communicate with the team in China? Answer: We will use English for official communication. We might also use translators when needed to make sure everyone understands. Question: Will there be ongoing support from Korea to the China team? Answer: Yes, we will keep supporting the China team.

예시: 인구를 성별, 연령대, 소득 수준 등으로 나누는 경우. 층별 표본 추출: 각 층에서 독립적으로 표본을 추출합니다. 추출 방법은 단순 무작위 추출 또는 체계적 추출 방법을 사용할 수 있습니다.
예시: 각 연령대에서 무작위로 100명씩 추출. 층 비율에 따른 할당: 각 층의 크기에 비례하여 표본을 추출합니다. 이는 모집단의 구조를 정확히 반영하기 위해 중요합니다.
예시: 모집단의 60%가 여성이고 40%가 남성일 경우, 전체 표본의 60%는 여성, 40%는 남성으로 추출. 표본의 대표성 향상: 각 층을 균형 있게 반영하여 표본의 대표성을 높입니다.
예시: 전체 인구를 성별, 연령별로 균형 있게 포함하여 분석 결과의 신뢰성을 높임. 분산 감소: 층화 표본추출법은 표본의 분산을 줄여 더 정확한 추정치를 제공합니다.
예시: 특정 연령대나 성별에 따른 변동성을 줄여 평균 수치를 더 정확하게 추정. 층별 분석 가능: 각 층별로 별도의 통계 분석이 가능하여 세부적인 인사이트를 얻을 수 있습니다.
예시: 연령대별 소비 패턴을 분석하여 맞춤형 마케팅 전략 수립. 층화 과정의 복잡성: 모집단을 적절히 층화하고, 각 층에서 표본을 추출하는 과정이 복잡할 수 있습니다.
예시: 모집단의 정확한 분포를 알기 어렵거나, 각 층의 크기를 정확히 파악하기 어려운 경우. 추가 비용 및 시간 소요: 층화를 위한 추가적인 정보 수집과 각 층별 표본 추출 과정에서 비용과 시간이 더 소요될 수 있습니다.
예시: 각 층에 대한 별도의 데이터 수집 및 분석 과정이 필요. 층화 기준: 학년 (1학년, 2학년, 3학년, 4학년)
층별 비율: 1학년: 250명 (25%)
2학년: 250명 (25%)
3학년: 250명 (25%)
4학년: 250명 (25%) 층별 표본 할당: 1학년: 50명 (25% of 200)
2학년: 50명 (25% of 200)
3학년: 50명 (25% of 200)
4학년: 50명 (25% of 200) 각 학년에서 무작위로 50명씩 추출하여 총 200명의 표본을 구성합니다. 이를 통해 각 학년을 균형 있게 대표하는 표본을 확보할 수 있습니다.층화표본추출법은 모집단을 더 잘 반영하는 표본을 얻기 위해 모집단을 여러 층으로 나누고 각 층에서 독립적으로 표본을 추출하는 방법입니다. 이 방법은 표본의 대표성을 높이고 분산을 줄이는 장점이 있지만, 층화를 위한 추가적인 비용과 시간 소요가 필요할 수 있습니다.<br>MOC:: <a data-href="📖 650 Telecommunications" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📖 650 Telecommunications</a><br>Depart. :: <a data-href="👤 5.

Do you have any thoughts on the information presented in the report?
Let’s set aside this topic for now and think about this a bit more before we make a final decision.
A. Hello, everyone. Today, we’re here to explore ways to boost our smartphone sales in the U.S. The first item on our agenda is reviewing our pricing strategy. Next, we’ll discuss distribution channels—whether to switch, expand, or optimize them. Finally, we’ll talk about how to enhance our marketing efforts. Let’s start with the first topic: our pricing strategy. Do you have any thoughts on?Q. When you hold meetings, which types of items do you generally like to discuss first? Why?
A. I usually set the first item as either the most important or the most controversial topic to ensure everyone is focused right from the start. However, this approach can vary depending on the purpose of the meeting. For instance, if I know someone critical to the discussion won’t be able to join on time, I might postpone the important item until later. Ultimately, the order of the agenda depends on the specific circumstances and goals of the meeting.Q. Which items do you generally postpone for discussion later?
A. The item that we need a time to figure out, or needed to research. If i judged that there are need of time for other people to figure out about the topic, I may postpone that for later. Well, I usually send attachments or references in advance to let them read that before coming on meeting]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/studies/english/spicus-(2024.10~2024.12)/unit-16.-structuring-a-discussion.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Studies/English/SPICUS (2024.10~2024.12)/Unit 16.

demographic

customer base In light of our current budget issues, we need to think about our options.
I like your idea of investing in social media advertisement, but I’m not sure I agree with decreasing our newspaper and TV ad costs.
It’s true that social media is a highly effective way to market, but don’t you think that we have to think about the older demographic as well?
Q. Express your opinion to your coworkers. Say you disagree and explain why.
A. Given our expanding business in China, I appreciate your suggestion to open an office in Beijing. However, I’m not entirely convinced about partnering with a local company. Don’t you think our presence in China is already strong enough? We also have many fluent Chinese speakers within our team, so a local partnership might not be necessary. Instead, we should focus on building strong relationships with key figures in the Chinese Communist Party.Q. Have you ever disagreed with your company’s business strategy? If so, in what ways, and why?
A. I wouldn’t say I disagree with my company’s business strategy, but I often find myself at odds with people who prioritize their personal preferences over the bigger picture. In meetings, even when I prefer to stay quiet, I often feel compelled to voice my opinion that our product needs to be as perfect as possible. Business is like survival in a jungle—no, it’s even more complex than that. In business, the victim often doesn’t realize they’ve been swallowed by a giant predator until it’s too late.Q. Have you ever had a disagreement with a client? If so, why and how was it resolved?
A. Situations like that can happen at any time. It might be related to design, functionality, or even user experience. While I don’t typically communicate with clients since my team’s work isn’t focused on customer care, if I do receive a customer complaint, I always strive to provide the best possible solution. First, I explain the reason behind the issue, and then I work on offering a reasonable solution that satisfies both sides. If that’s not possible, I usually propose an option that favors the client.Hello, Yangha!
Looking at the sentences you mentioned, I think a few small changes could make them sound more natural and clear.
In the first sentence,&nbsp;"We still invest money on that.", it would be more natural to use&nbsp;"in"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"on".
"We still invest money "in" that."&nbsp;sounds much smoother.
In the second sentence,&nbsp;"I feel much on this sentence.", using an expression like&nbsp;"strongly"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"much"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"I feel "strongly" about this sentence."
In the third sentence,&nbsp;"I will loss my job but i don't feel afraid on that.", using&nbsp;"lose"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"loss", and&nbsp;"about that"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"on that"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"I will "lose" my job but I don't feel afraid "about" that."
In the fourth sentence,&nbsp;"My co-worker suggested to get a partnership to a local company.", using&nbsp;"to partner with"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"to get a partnership"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"My co-worker suggested "to partner with" a local company."
In the last sentence,&nbsp;"We have many fluent Chinese speaker at our company.", you need to add&nbsp;"s"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"speaker"&nbsp;to make it plural.
"We have many fluent Chinese "speakers" at our company."
You're doing really well, and I can see you're improving bit by bit.
Keep up the good work!]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/studies/english/spicus-(2024.10~2024.12)/unit-15.-agreeing-and-disagreeing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Studies/English/SPICUS (2024.10~2024.12)/Unit 15.

Review - Working on Projects]]></title><description><![CDATA[Hello, Yangha! I'll tell you how to make the sentences you mentioned sound more natural.
The first sentence,&nbsp;"I experience typhoon too."&nbsp;would sound more natural as&nbsp;"I experienced a typhoon too."&nbsp;"Experience"&nbsp;is a verb that means to have something happen to you, so when you're talking about something that happened in the past, you need to use the past tense,&nbsp;"experienced."&nbsp;And&nbsp;"typhoon"&nbsp;is a natural phenomenon, so it's good to put&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;in front of it.
The second sentence,&nbsp;"We will have a global meeting next next week."&nbsp;can be simplified to&nbsp;"We will have a global meeting next week."&nbsp;"Next next week"&nbsp;is a common expression in Korean, but in English,&nbsp;"next week"&nbsp;is enough to convey the meaning.
The third sentence,&nbsp;"I think I had a lot of issues with outsourcing."&nbsp;is excellent! This sentence is perfect.
The fourth sentence,&nbsp;"Some of our sub-constructors provided with some effects."&nbsp;would sound more natural as&nbsp;"Some of our sub-constructors provided some effects."&nbsp;Using&nbsp;"provided"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"provided with"&nbsp;makes the sentence more concise and natural.
The last sentence,&nbsp;"We tried to figure out what is the real reason for the bad product."&nbsp;can be changed to&nbsp;"We tried to figure out the real reason for the bad product."&nbsp;Omitting&nbsp;"what is"&nbsp;makes the sentence more concise and natural.
Your English skills have really improved! With a little more practice, you'll be able to communicate perfectly in English.

There are a few things we need to iron out.
We’ll contact each of your departments to get the ball rolling on fixing these problems.
Hello, Yangha! I see some areas where you can make your sentences sound more natural.
With a few small changes, you can make your writing clearer and more concise.
First sentence,&nbsp;"They don't have interest in my project."&nbsp;Instead of&nbsp;"interest."&nbsp;you can use&nbsp;"interested"for a more natural expression.
"They are not interested in my project"&nbsp;would be better.
Second sentence,&nbsp;"It is too spicy for them to general people."&nbsp;Instead of&nbsp;"general people."&nbsp;"the general public"&nbsp;is a more familiar expression, and instead of&nbsp;"for,"using&nbsp;"for them to be"&nbsp;makes the sentence smoother.
How about changing it to&nbsp;"It is too spicy for them to be comfortable with."?
Third sentence&nbsp;"We need to minimize the spicy taste."is great! You're doing well.
Fourth sentence,&nbsp;"They think computer do everything."Instead of&nbsp;"computer do."&nbsp;using&nbsp;"computers can do"makes the sentence more natural.
Try changing it to&nbsp;"They think computers can do everything."
Last sentence,&nbsp;"It is always hard to address issue to them."&nbsp;Using&nbsp;"address issues with them"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"address issue to them"&nbsp;is more natural, and changing&nbsp;"it is always hard"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"it's always difficult"&nbsp;makes it look cleaner.
How about changing it to&nbsp;"It's always difficult to address issues with them."?
Yangha, it's great to see your continuous efforts! With a little more practice, you'll become a perfect English speaker!

benefits program
take a survey
high-end consumer I was looking into ways to improve our membership card.
While the initial idea to let everyone receive the same benefits is a good one, I think that it might be better to focus on one specific target group.
Why don’t we first take a survey of our competitors’ high-end consumer rewards programs?
Q. Make a suggestion to your team at the meeting. Explain your reasoning in detail.
A. I’ve been looking into ways to increase insurance sales and have a suggestion. a “Referral program”. It doesn’t simply means that giving temporary discounts to people who refer their friends. We’ll give special discounts on their monthly insurance payment. That would help build long-term loyalty, rather than just giving short-term perks.Q. At team meetings, do you consider yourself shy or do you speak up and make suggestions about ways to improve projects?
A: I have a lot of ideas, and I want to achieve something meaningful in both my current projects and my career. I want to gain more experience, even if it sometimes leads to failure. I always tell myself, “One success is enough to change my life.” I might face challenges and fail, but as long as I don’t give up, I’ll grow stronger and eventually reach the top. That’s why I always share my opinions, even when others stay quiet. I understand they might be afraid of failing, but I’m willing to take the risk.Q. What types of suggestions would you make to the way in which your team operates?
A. I would suggest getting rid of outdated customs that are no longer necessary. While we can improve our work by adopting better approaches, we can also make progress by reducing waste in our processes. This doesn’t mean I disregard the traditions we have; I believe there is valuable wisdom in them, and I aim to learn from that to create a better future.
At the same time, I understand the importance of maintaining a relaxed work atmosphere because it helps people perform better. I’m not overly focused on efficiency alone, but it’s important to remember that a company’s primary goal is to make money—that’s the reason it exists. That’s why I prioritize efficiency above all else.Q. What would you improve about employee benefits at your company?
A. I want to create a culture that people are excited to be a part of. In our workplace, we should share ideas openly, regardless of our position, and discuss ways to improve both our work environment and our lives. If we can make our work genuinely engaging and meaningful, the concept of “work-life balance” might not even feel necessary.
I enjoy what I do, and I want others to feel the same way—instead of quietly complaining about the company. We have the power to change our circumstances, and I want everyone to realize that and be part of that change.Hello, Ha Yang! Looking at the sentences you mentioned, I think a few minor edits can make them sound more natural and clear.
The first sentence,&nbsp;"They discuss strategy on increasing insurance sales."&nbsp;is almost perfect, but using&nbsp;"for"instead of&nbsp;"on"&nbsp;would make it more natural.
"They discuss strategy for increasing insurance sales"sounds better, right? It's a great sentence!
The second sentence,&nbsp;"I suggest referral program."&nbsp;can be improved by adding&nbsp;"a"&nbsp;before&nbsp;"referral program."&nbsp;"I suggest a referral program"&nbsp;sounds much more natural.
The third sentence,&nbsp;"Many people just want money."&nbsp;is correct, but how about using a more varied expression?&nbsp;"Many people are simply motivated by money"&nbsp;would be a richer and more natural expression.
You're doing really well! With small adjustments, you'll develop perfect English skills.I made a lot of mistakes today that I noticed while speaking. If I want to improve my English, I need to put myself in situations where I can speak it more often. I live in Nonsan, and I could use the excuse that there aren’t many opportunities to speak English here. But that’s just an excuse. I shouldn’t blame my environment—if I don’t like it, I know it’s up to me to change it.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/studies/english/spicus-(2024.10~2024.12)/unit-14.-making-suggestions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Studies/English/SPICUS (2024.10~2024.12)/Unit 14.

touch base Then we can figure out what we can do to fix the issue.
How can we figure out the answer to this question without any help?
That is the reason why I called this meeting.
Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining on short notice. We have an urgent matter to discuss today regarding the faulty design of our reclining chair, which has unfortunately caused injuries to a few customers. This is a serious issue, and our priority is to ensure customer safety while protecting our brand reputation. Let’s focus on identifying the problem, finding immediate solutions, and setting a timeline for resolution.Before we start, let’s quickly go over the agenda for today’s meeting:
Review the reported design issue and customer feedback.
Brainstorm potential immediate fixes and long-term solutions.
Discuss communication with affected customers.
Assign action items and propose a follow-up meeting to review progress.
Does anyone have additional points to add before we dive in?Q. How often do you have team meetings? What types of issues are usually discussed at those meetings?
A. We hold regular meetings three times a week—on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays—where we primarily discuss issues related to the production line. Our focus is on manufacturing battery cells and BESS, and we’re always vigilant about preventing defects.Q. Have you had meetings with foreigners? If so, what types of issues have you had communicating?
A. Our headquarters is in Israel, so the team there has a distinctive accent. As you know, we Koreans typically don’t have a noticeable accent, which sometimes makes communication challenging at first. However, once I get used to someone’s accent and pronunciation, it’s no longer an issue. Time takes care of everything.Q. How do you like to run your meetings? Formally? Informally? Who sets the agenda and how strictly do you stick to it?
A. I usually hold meetings in a formal manner. I set the agenda in advance and share it with the attendees beforehand. I don't like wasting time in meetings, so I strive to keep them short and focused. To achieve this, I make sure to stick closely to the agenda.You conveyed your thoughts on the subject we discussed without difficulty. You even used detailed sentences to answer the questions I asked you. However, please add CURRENTLY to your vocabulary bank. It means at the present time. e.g. I'm currently drinking tea.
Note: I'm currently drinking tea. -ALTERNATIVE EXPRESSION
We held meetings thrice a week. -ALTERNATIVE EXPRESSION
The first agenda was about system issues on their website. -COMPLETE SENTENCE]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/studies/english/spicus-(2024.10~2024.12)/unit-13.-running-a-meeting.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Studies/English/SPICUS (2024.10~2024.12)/Unit 13.

Let’s grab dinner sometime and catch up properly.
I’m afraid that I won’t be able to next week.
Q. Have you attended any high school or college reunions? How was the experience?
What did you discuss with your former classmates?
Did you share any fun stories or hear of any?
A. I dropped out of high school in my first year, and similarly, I also left college in my freshman year. After that, I attended two colleges in Australia, but now that I’m in Korea, it’s hard to meet the friends I made back then. I don’t keep in touch with anyone. Maybe I’m not someone who keeps a wide circle of connections.Q. Do you keep in touch with former colleagues?
How often do you meet them?
What do you talk about?
A. I meet up with my former colleagues about once every few months. We usually drink together until we get wasted. And that’s all we do, Korean old men’s style. Of course, we have some conversation while drinking. Our topics are commonly works or trivial things we’ve done like as before.Q. What was the last conference or business-networking event that you attended? Did you meet any foreigners?
If so, what did you discuss?
A. I attended Microsoft’s AI Tour event about six months ago. I met a lot of people there, but we didn’t really have any in-depth discussions. I mostly just listened to the conference and joined in on the activities they had prepared. I went by myself, unlike many others who came with their colleagues as a team. Anyway, there were so many people from all around the world. But I wasn’t quite brave enough to approach them and start a conversation. It felt like I was the only one there on my own.Hello, Yangha! With just a few small changes, you can express yourself even more clearly.
The first sentence is almost perfect! Instead of&nbsp;"I'll call you back in the next week."&nbsp;it would be more natural to say&nbsp;"I'll call you back next week."
In the second sentence, instead of&nbsp;"Are you available on that time?", it should be&nbsp;"Are you available at that time?".
It's more natural to use&nbsp;"at"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"on."
In the last sentence, instead of&nbsp;"Where you stay?", it should be&nbsp;"Where do you stay?".
After&nbsp;"Where."&nbsp;you need to add&nbsp;"do"&nbsp;and before&nbsp;"stay"you need to add&nbsp;"you"&nbsp;to make a complete sentence.
Yangha, your English skills have improved so much! If you keep working hard, you'll become even more perfect!]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/studies/english/spicus-(2024.10~2024.12)/unit-12.-review-socializing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Studies/English/SPICUS (2024.10~2024.12)/Unit 12.

Hello, Yangha!
After reviewing the sentences you mentioned, I think they can be made even more natural with a few minor corrections!
In the first sentence, "There not too many changes.", you need to add "are" after "There" to make it a complete sentence.
"There are not too many changes." sounds much more natural.
The second sentence, "They are not just useful but also necessary.", is perfectly correct! You did a great job!
In the third sentence, "Database should be no malfunction.", it's more natural to use "malfunction-free" instead of "no malfunction".
"Database should be malfunction-free." sounds smoother.
In the fourth sentence, "Our expectations for database shouldn't be too different.", it's better to add "the" before "database".
"Our expectations for the database shouldn't be too different." conveys the meaning more accurately.
In the fifth sentence, "We have many contractors because we are manufacturing company.", it's better to change "manufacturing company" to "a manufacturing company".
"We have many contractors because we are a manufacturing company." makes for a more natural sentence.
Yangha, with just a few grammatical tweaks, these are really great English sentences! Keep practicing and your skills will definitely improve!
There not too many changes.
→ There aren’t too many changes.
They are not just useful but also necessary.
→ They’re not just useful but also essential.
Database should be no malfunction.
→ The database should be free of malfunctions.
Our expectations for database shouldn’t be too different.
→ Our expectations for the database shouldn’t differ too much.
We have many contractors because we are manufacturing company.
→ We have many contractors because we’re a manufacturing company.

IPO(Initial Public Offering)
at this point It seems like we’re going to have to push back the deadline.
The problem is that we don’t have much wiggle room with the deadline.
It’s best to have this project finished on time, no matter the cost.
The sentences you said today are almost perfect! However, with a few minor adjustments, they can become even clearer and more natural English sentences.The first sentence, “Due to bad weather in contractor’s country, the deadline will be delayed.” is really well said! If you write “the contractor” instead of “contractor’s”, it will be even more perfect.
Adding “the” makes it clear that “contractor’s” refers to a specific contractor.The second sentence, “I think to that work for 2 days only.” sounds a bit awkward.
“I’ll work” is a more natural expression than “I think to that work”.
“I’ll work for 2 days only” is a complete sentence.The third sentence, “Some people doesn’t meet the requirement for work.” should be “don’t” instead of “doesn’t”.The fourth sentence, “I am still thinking about how should I do?” should be “to” instead of “should”. “I am still thinking about how to do?” sounds more natural.The last sentence, “It very complicated.”
should be “It’s very complicated.” English sentences need a subject and a verb to be complete sentences.You’re doing really well! You seem to be very good at English, Yangha.
Keep practicing and you will be able to develop even more fluent English skills.]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/studies/english/spicus-(2024.10~2024.12)/unit-3.-explaining-project-setbacks.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Studies/English/SPICUS (2024.10~2024.12)/Unit 3.

I took a gamble thinking that if I took a taxi, I could make it to Grand Central on time.
I think I’d better take the subway.
Q. What is the funniest story you have ever heard from a colleague? What was it about?
A. It was Halloween recently. One of my friend was asked to attend a Halloween party in Seoul. And He was heard that the dress code is “black”. So he decided to wear black tights to make some fun. He thought other people may wear some kind of costume which fit for Halloween. And the day that the party held, he found that it wasn’t a party he expected. He saw everyone’s in black suit. I don’t know what happened the next, but my friend showed me a picture he took at that party. It was so weird, he stood around the people who’s in formal suits.→ It was Halloween recently, and one of my friends was invited to a Halloween party in Seoul. He was told that the dress code was “black,” so, hoping to add a bit of fun, he decided to wear black tights, thinking everyone would show up in Halloween costumes.
But when he arrived at the party, it wasn’t quite what he’d expected. He looked around and realized everyone else was dressed in formal black suits. I’m not sure what happened next, but he showed me a picture from that night—it was hilarious! There he was, standing in a crowd of people in business attire, completely out of place in his costume.Q. Have you had any interesting situations that occurred while traveling for business? What happened?
A. I don’t have any.Q. At lunch, what do you discuss with your coworkers?
A. We talked about the business documents of our company which address rules, procedures, and standards of our works. We all know that documents are not good enough, so we discuss how to make it better but we found that it’s really hard to change others, not us. And our roles are not making that kind of docs. So we ended up the talk saying our discussion will goes for nothing.→ We talked about our company’s business documents that outline the rules, procedures, and standards for our work. We all agreed that these documents aren’t quite up to par, so we discussed ways to improve them. But we realized it’s tough to bring about change when it involves others, not just ourselves. Besides, creating these documents isn’t actually our responsibility. In the end, we wrapped up the conversation, admitting that our discussion probably wouldn’t lead to much.Hello, Park Yangha/David!
Looking at the sentences you mentioned, I see that a few small adjustments could make them even more natural English sentences!In the first sentence,&nbsp;"It take me to two hours to get the hotel."&nbsp;you should change&nbsp;"It take"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"It takes.""It takes"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"it takes time,"&nbsp;while&nbsp;"take"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"to take up time,"&nbsp;so it was used incorrectly.
"to"&nbsp;indicates a&nbsp;"destination,"&nbsp;so changing it to&nbsp;"get to the hotel"&nbsp;would be more natural.In the second sentence,&nbsp;"There are so many bike driver."&nbsp;you should change it to&nbsp;"There are so many bike drivers."&nbsp;"driver"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"driver,"&nbsp;and the plural form is&nbsp;"drivers."The third sentence,&nbsp;"Maybe in the next year, I will go to Bohol."&nbsp;is well written, but it could also be written as&nbsp;"Maybe next year, I will go to Bohol."&nbsp;It's a simpler way to express it.In the fourth sentence,&nbsp;"Bohol is one of the best spot for scuba diving."&nbsp;you should change it to&nbsp;"Bohol is one of the best spots for scuba diving."&nbsp;"spot"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"place,"&nbsp;and the plural form is&nbsp;"spots."In the last sentence,&nbsp;"The taxi driver was waiting to me."&nbsp;you should change it to&nbsp;"The taxi driver was waiting for me."&nbsp;"waiting for"&nbsp;means&nbsp;"waiting,"&nbsp;so using&nbsp;"for"&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;"to"&nbsp;would be more natural.Good job, David! Keep practicing and you'll be able to write perfect English sentences.I’m able to recognize my mistakes when I speak in English, I still omit “s”, use singular form very often. I understand how to use “s” in a proper way but it seems hard to get used to it. I want to count how many days will it take.

Q. Have you ever had issues with trying to meet with someone because of scheduling conflicts? How did you resolve those situations?
A. I rarely encounter scheduling conflicts when it comes to business, but sometimes it’s challenging to meet my friends at a time when we can all get together. Unlike me, most of my friends are married, so they have their own families and need to take care of their children as well. This simply means that I have to adjust my schedule to fit theirs, but that’s no problem as long as we get to meet.Q. What type of software do you use to keep track of your meetings? Why?
A. I use several Microsoft applications to manage my schedule and meetings, especially Teams, Planner, and Outlook. Our company provides licenses for these tools, and they’re quite effective for organizing my time and tasks. That said, I prefer Google Calendar for my personal life. With Google Assistant, I can easily add events by voice—like saying, ‘Hey Google, schedule a doctor’s appointment for this Saturday at 9 am’ It then reminds me when the time comes.Q. If an urgent issue came up and you had to reschedule a meeting, how would you handle the problem?
A. I’ll inform the attendees as soon as possible and try to reschedule the meeting after addressing the urgent issue. If they’re unavailable at the new time, the meeting isn’t the only option—we can still discuss via email or chat. Another good option is holding a Zoom meeting. I typically have online meetings rather than in-person ones, as my company is international.Even with a few grammatical mistakes, your sentences conveyed your message clearly. Kindly review adjectives and verbs and practice using them correctly.

예시: 전력 회사가 여름철 전력 사용량을 줄이기 위해 홍보 캠페인을 펼치는 경우. 환경 보호: 환경에 해로운 제품이나 서비스를 줄이기 위해 사용됩니다.
예시: 플라스틱 사용을 줄이기 위한 캠페인. 사회적 책임: 건강에 해롭거나 사회에 부정적인 영향을 미치는 제품의 소비를 줄이기 위해 사용됩니다.
예시: 담배 소비를 줄이기 위한 정부의 금연 캠페인. 브랜드 관리: 브랜드의 이미지를 보호하기 위해 특정 제품이나 고객 세그먼트에서 벗어나기 위해 사용됩니다.
예시: 고급 브랜드가 할인 판매를 줄여 브랜드 이미지를 유지하려는 경우. 정의: 가격을 높여 수요를 줄이는 방법.
예시: 공공 요금 인상, 주류세 인상. 정의: 특정 제품의 광고를 줄여 소비자의 관심을 낮추는 방법.
예시: 건강에 해로운 제품의 광고를 제한하는 정책. 정의: 제품의 판매 채널을 줄이거나 접근성을 낮추는 방법.
예시: 담배 판매를 특정 구역으로 제한. 정의: 제품의 부정적인 면을 강조하여 소비를 줄이는 방법.
예시: 담배 포장에 건강 경고 문구를 삽입. 정의: 소비자들이 더 나은 대체재를 선택하도록 유도하는 방법.
예시: 일회용 플라스틱 대신 재사용 가능한 제품을 권장. 공공 서비스: 전력 회사가 여름철 에너지 사용을 줄이기 위해 디 마케팅 캠페인을 펼치는 경우. 이는 에어컨 사용을 줄이기 위한 가격 인상이나 광고를 통해 전력 소비를 줄이려는 노력입니다. 건강 관련 제품: 정부가 금연 캠페인을 통해 담배 소비를 줄이기 위한 경우. 이는 담배 가격 인상, 광고 축소, 부정적 정보 제공 등의 전략을 포함합니다. 환경 보호: 플라스틱 사용을 줄이기 위해 정부나 기업이 디 마케팅 전략을 사용하는 경우. 이는 재사용 가능한 대체 제품을 장려하고, 플라스틱 제품의 사용을 억제하는 캠페인을 포함합니다. 디 마케팅은 특정 제품이나 서비스에 대한 소비자의 수요를 줄이기 위해 사용되는 전략으로, 다양한 목적과 방법을 통해 구현될 수 있습니다. 이는 기업이나 정부가 자원 관리, 환경 보호, 사회적 책임을 실현하기 위해 중요한 역할을 합니다.MOC:: <a data-href="📖 650 Telecommunications" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📖 650 Telecommunications</a><br>Depart. :: <a data-href="👤 5.

예시: 스마트폰의 속성 (가격, 배터리 수명, 카메라 품질)과 각 속성의 수준 (가격: $300, $500, $700; 배터리 수명: 12시간, 24시간; 카메라 품질: 12MP, 20MP). 프로파일 생성 정의된 속성과 수준을 조합하여 여러 개의 제품 또는 서비스 프로파일을 생성합니다.
예시: 가격 $300, 배터리 수명 12시간, 카메라 품질 12MP인 스마트폰. 응답자 평가 소비자들에게 각 프로파일을 평가하도록 요청합니다. 평가 방식은 순위 매기기, 선택, 평점 부여 등이 있습니다.
예시: 여러 스마트폰 프로파일 중에서 가장 선호하는 것을 선택하게 함. 통계 분석 수집된 데이터를 기반으로 통계적 기법 (예: 회귀 분석)을 사용하여 각 속성의 중요도와 수준별 유효성을 추정합니다.
예시: 배터리 수명이 24시간일 때 소비자 선호도가 얼마나 증가하는지 분석. 컨조인트 분석 결과는 각 속성의 상대적 중요도와 각 수준의 효용치를 제공합니다. 이를 통해 기업은 다음과 같은 인사이트를 얻을 수 있습니다:
속성 중요도: 각 속성이 전체 제품 선택에 얼마나 중요한지.
수준 효용치: 각 속성 수준이 소비자에게 얼마나 가치 있는지. 제품 개발: 컨조인트 분석을 통해 소비자가 선호하는 속성 조합을 파악하고, 이를 바탕으로 제품을 개발합니다.
예시: 소비자들이 배터리 수명을 가장 중요하게 생각한다면, 배터리 수명이 긴 제품을 개발. 가격 전략: 속성과 수준별로 소비자가 지불할 의향이 있는 가격을 파악하여 적절한 가격 정책을 수립합니다.
예시: 소비자들이 $500의 가격을 선호한다면, 그 가격에 맞추어 제품을 출시. 시장 세분화: 서로 다른 선호도를 가진 소비자 그룹을 식별하여, 맞춤형 마케팅 전략을 수립합니다.
예시: 가격 민감도가 높은 소비자 그룹과 기능을 중시하는 소비자 그룹을 구분하여 각각 다른 마케팅 전략을 적용. 이 예시에서 소비자는 배터리 수명이 24시간인 프로파일을 가장 선호했음을 알 수 있습니다.MOC:: <a data-href="📖 650 Telecommunications" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📖 650 Telecommunications</a><br>Depart. :: <a data-href="👤 5.

예시: 가전제품, 의류, 가구, 자동차. 정의: 특정 브랜드나 제품을 선호하여 특별히 찾아서 구매하는 제품들.
특징: 소비자는 특정 브랜드나 제품에 강한 애착을 가지고 있으며, 대체재가 아닌 그 특정 제품을 구매하기 위해 노력합니다.
예시: 명품 시계, 고급 자동차, 디자이너 의류, 특정 브랜드의 전자제품. 정의: 소비자가 잘 알지 못하거나 평소에 필요성을 느끼지 못하지만 필요할 때 갑자기 구매하게 되는 제품들.
특징: 이 제품들은 광고나 프로모션을 통해 소비자에게 인식되고 필요시 구매됩니다. 소비자는 이러한 제품을 적극적으로 찾지 않지만, 필요 시 구매하게 됩니다.
예시: 보험, 장례 서비스, 응급구조 키트.
이와 같은 소비재의 분류는 마케팅 전략을 세울 때 중요한 기준이 됩니다. 각 분류에 따라 제품의 광고, 유통, 가격 전략이 달라집니다.MOC:: <a data-href="📖 650 Telecommunications" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📖 650 Telecommunications</a><br>Depart. :: <a data-href="👤 5.

단점: 목표 설정과 평가 과정이 시간이 많이 소요될 수 있습니다. 정의: 다양한 평가 기법을 통합하여 종합적으로 직원을 평가하는 방법입니다.
특징: 시뮬레이션, 역할 연기, 그룹 토론, 프레젠테이션 등 여러 평가 기법을 사용합니다.
장점: 다각도로 직원의 역량을 평가할 수 있으며, 객관성이 높습니다.
단점: 준비와 실행에 많은 비용과 시간이 소요됩니다. 정의: 직원의 상사, 동료, 부하 직원, 고객 등 다양한 이해관계자로부터 피드백을 받는 방법입니다.
특징: 다각적인 평가를 통해 보다 객관적이고 종합적인 피드백을 제공합니다.
장점: 다양한 관점을 반영하여 직원의 강점과 개선점을 파악할 수 있습니다.
단점: 피드백 제공자의 주관성이 개입될 수 있으며, 피드백을 수집하고 분석하는 과정이 복잡할 수 있습니다. 정의: 특정 직무와 관련된 구체적인 행동 기준을 바탕으로 평가하는 방법입니다.
특징: 행동 기준을 미리 정의하고, 이를 기준으로 평가합니다.
장점: 평가의 구체성과 일관성을 높이며, 평가자의 주관성을 줄일 수 있습니다.
단점: 행동 기준을 설정하는 과정이 복잡하고 시간이 많이 소요될 수 있습니다. 정의: 미리 정해진 기준에 따라 직원의 성과나 역량을 평가척도로 평가하는 방법입니다.
특징: 성과나 역량을 숫자나 등급으로 평가합니다.
장점: 간단하고 사용하기 쉬우며, 비교적 비용이 적게 듭니다.
단점: 평가자의 주관성이 개입될 가능성이 있으며, 구체적인 피드백이 부족할 수 있습니다. 목표: "분기 내 신규 고객 20명 유치"
평가: 분기 말에 목표 달성 여부를 확인하고, 달성도에 따라 성과를 평가 구성 요소: 시뮬레이션(프레젠테이션), 역할 연기(고객 상담), 그룹 토론(문제 해결)
평가: 각 구성 요소별 평가 결과를 종합하여 최종 성과 평가

예시: 구매할 스마트폰 모델들. 속성 (Attributes) 대안을 평가하는 기준이 되는 요소들.
예시: 가격, 배터리 수명, 카메라 품질, 저장 용량. 가중치 (Weights) 각 속성의 중요도를 나타내는 수치.
예시: 가격(0.4), 배터리 수명(0.3), 카메라 품질(0.2), 저장 용량(0.1). 속성 점수 (Attribute Scores) 각 대안이 속성별로 받는 점수.
예시: 스마트폰 A의 가격 점수 8, 배터리 수명 점수 7, 카메라 품질 점수 9, 저장 용량 점수 6. 속성 선정 및 가중치 설정 의사결정에 중요한 속성들을 선택하고, 각 속성의 중요도에 따라 가중치를 부여합니다. 대안별 속성 점수 평가 각 대안에 대해 각 속성별로 점수를 부여합니다. 속성 점수와 가중치의 곱 계산 각 대안의 속성 점수에 해당 속성의 가중치를 곱합니다.
예시: 스마트폰 A의 가격 가중치(0.4) * 가격 점수(8) = 3.2. 총 점수 합산 각 대안의 모든 속성 점수와 가중치의 곱을 합산하여 최종 점수를 계산합니다.
예시: 스마트폰 A의 최종 점수 = 3.2 (가격) + 2.1 (배터리 수명) + 1.8 (카메라 품질) + 0.6 (저장 용량) = 7.7. 최고 점수 대안 선택 최종 점수가 가장 높은 대안을 선택합니다. 위의 예시에서 스마트폰 A가 최종 점수가 가장 높아 선택됩니다.MOC:: <a data-href="📖 650 Telecommunications" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📖 650 Telecommunications</a><br>Depart. :: <a data-href="👤 5.

‘리더의 원칙’을 정립한 가장 완벽한 고전을 탐구하다!교황청이 금서로 지정한 ‘악마의 책’, 히틀러와 무솔리니가 애독한 ‘독재자의 교본’으로 알려진 『군주론』. 하지만 루소는 '공화주의자의 교과서'로 칭송했고 프랜시스 베이컨은 '인간이 하고 있는 일을 숨김없이 밝혀낸 마키아벨리에게 큰 신세를 졌다'고 극찬을 아끼지 않았다. 500년 전에 쓰여진 이 책이 논란이 끊이지 않는 이유와 21세기를 살아가야 하는 우리가 읽어야 할 이유는 무엇일까?이 책의 감수 및 해제를 맡은 김상근 교수는 혼란의 시기를 살아가는 현대인이라면 누구나 『군주론』을 일독하길 권하고 있다. ‘대혼란의 아수라장’ 자체였던 16세기 이탈리아는 교황이 처자식과 첩을 거느리고, 군주는 적이 아닌 매독균과 싸웠으며, 수도원장이 기도를 멈추고 정치 일선에 나섰던 시대다. 정통과 사이비를 구별할 수 없고 5개의 강대국이 충돌하며 승자와 패자가 하룻밤 사이에 바뀌던 시대에 공동체의 운명을 책임져야 하는 리더의 현실적인 처세와 방법을 제시한 책이 바로 『군주론』이기 때문이다.『군주론』은 이미 다양한 형태의 번역본이 출간되어 있지만 이 책의 본질을 제대로 독자에게 알리고자 책의 구성과 편집에 정성을 담았다. 뛰어난 문장가였던 마키아벨리의 행간을 제대로 풀어내고자, 마키아벨리 전기를 집필한 연세대학교 신과대학 김상근 교수의 해제(1~26장, 150페이지 분량)를 장별로 제공하고 있으며, 번역에 대한 신뢰를 높이고자 로마 라사피엔자대학교의 중세-르네상스 이탈리아어 문학부 교수인 조르조 잉글레제(Giorgio Inglese)가 편집한 『군주론』(2013년 증보판)을 저본으로 삼고, 하버드대학교 하비 맨스필드 교수의 영역본과 부산대학교 곽차섭 교수의 번역본 등을 비교 대조하여 원서의 문맥과 의미를 훼손되지 않도록 하였다.특히 『군주론』을 집필한 저자 마키아벨리에 대한 이해도를 높이기 위한 인물 해설(‘마키아벨리는 어떤 사람인가’, 38페이지 분량)과 이 책의 집필 배경과 의미를 되짚은 작품 해설(‘『군주론』은 어떤 책인가’, 9페이지 분량)을 수록하여 독서의 흥미와 가독성을 높이고 있다.

애덤 스미스가 말하는 신뢰와 도덕, 정의와 양심의 경제학‘보이지 않는 손’이라는 대명제로 우리에게 친숙한 경제학자 애덤 스미스는 특유의 혜안과 식견으로 예술, 자연과학, 법률, 정치학, 경제학 등 여러 분야에서 실로 막대한 영향을 끼쳤다. 애덤 스미스는 동시대인들에게 계시와 같은 존재였지만 그가 전하는 진정한 메시지는 이백 년 동안 서투른 모방과 오보에 가려져 누가 어떻게 해석하고 적용하느냐에 따라 의견이 분분했다. 그러나 전 세계의 경제 상황이 악화되고 자본주의와 시장경제에 대한 반성과 재진단이 요구되는 시점에서, 시장경제의 필수사항인 신뢰, 도덕, 덕성을 강조하는 애덤 스미스의 철학이 우리 사회와 비즈니스를 존속시키는 데 있어서 가장 중요한 원리임을 깨닫게 되었다. 교과서에서만 만날 수 있었던 애덤 스미스의 사상을 쉽게 풀어내며 ‘세계화에 관한 격렬한 논쟁에 접근해 해답을 찾아가는 경이로운 학술 소설’ ‘세계 유명 대학이 교재로 선택한 단 하나의 경제학 팩션’이라는 평가를 받고 있는 『애덤 스미스 구하기』가 북스토리 출판사에서 재출간되었다.조나단 B. 와이트의 『애덤 스미스 구하기』는 현대 사회에 부활한 애덤 스미스의 철학과 사상을 소설 형식으로 풀어 쓴 경제 교양서로, 부의 창출과 상거래, 시장 실패와 국가의 역할, 신규 시장의 구조 개혁, 자본주의의 도덕적 토대, 경영과 윤리 등에 관한 내용을 흥미진진한 모험 소설 속에 풀어내고 있다. 『국부론』을 통해 우리에게 알려진 애덤 스미스의 사상과 철학을 그의 또 다른 명저인 『도덕감정론』의 측면에서 재조명하며 오늘날의 자본주의 체제와 시장경제에 일침을 가한다. 본질적인 것, 즉 사람들이 정의에 관심을 가지고 도덕을 함양하고자 하는 노력이 외면당함으로 인해 자유로운 사회와 시장이 심각하게 위협받고 있다는 메시지가 바로 그가 던지는 경고다. 현대 자본주의 체제에 부활한 애덤 스미스는 경제학자인 주인공 번스와 함께 오늘날의 주요 뉴스를 낱낱이 파헤치며 가슴 뛰는 모험을 전개한다. 긴박하면서도 절묘한 사건 속에서 주인공 번스는 시장 경제에 대한 애덤 스미스의 심오한 통찰력을 재발견한다. 이를 통해 애덤 스미스의 사상과 철학이 오늘날의 시장경제와 비즈니스 세계에 투영하는 실질적인 의미는 무엇인지를 고찰할 수 있다.Part 1 부 (Wealth)

새로운 생각의 출발점이 되는 고전 중의 고전
국내 유일 단권 완역본『국부론』은 단순히 경제학적 인사이트뿐만 아니라 철학, 정치, 역사, 종교, 교육, 문화 등 여러 분야의 정보를 제공하는 책이다. 국제전이었던 7년 전쟁(1756~1763), 미국 독립전쟁(1775~1783) 등 중요 사건들을 배경으로, 국부가 어떻게 쌓이고 흘러가며 역사를 바꾸는지에 대한 인문적인 통찰과 스미스의 사유 체계가 담겨 있어 가히 통합 인문서의 느낌을 준다. 그런 만큼 이 책은 세계를 객관적 시선으로 관찰하려 했던 18세기 최고 지식인이 세상을 바라본 안목을 잘 보여준다.스미스는 분업과 기계화를 통해 재능의 차이가 생기고, 그것이 시장에서 평화롭고 합리적인 교환을 거쳐 거래되는 것이 자유주의 경제라고 주장했다. 인간이 자신을 사랑하는 행동을 충실히 해나갈 때 ‘보이지 않는 손’(invisible hand)이 작용해 사회의 공동선이 강력하게 추진된다고 여겼다. 저자에 따르면 국부는 노동 투입 기술과 효율성에 따라 증가한다. 즉, 국가와 개인이 많은 생산물을 내놓을수록 부유한 나라라는 것이다. 지금은 상식적인 생각이지만, 금은의 축적을 국부의 핵심이라고 여긴 스미스 당시의 중상주의 시대에는 새롭고 혁명적인 사상이었다.『국부론』은 총 5권으로 구성되는데 1-2권은 경제 이론이고, 3권은 로마 이래 산업 발달의 역사를 개관하고, 4권은 중상주의와 중농주의 경제 이론을 비판하고 있으며, 5권은 국가 운영과 사법행정에 소요되는 경비와 수입원(세금과 공채)에 대해 기술하면서 법학과 정치학까지 섭렵한다.현대지성 클래식은 53번째로 『국부론』을 펴내면서, 250년 전에 쓰인 방대하고 난해한 원문 전체를 쉽고 명확하게 옮겼을 뿐만 아니라, 마음만 먹으면 청소년도 읽어나갈 수 있을 정도로 가독성 높게 글을 다듬었다. 더 깊은 이해를 위한 수백 개의 친절한 각주와 함께, 시대 배경과 저자에 대한 수준 높은 해제를 제공해 “한번 붙잡으면 끝까지 읽을 수 있는 책”이 되도록 했다. 시대 흐름을 주도하고, 전략적인 사고를 하기로 유명한 일론 머스크가 “내 인생 최고의 책이다!”라고 극찬을 아끼지 않은 이유를 알 수 있을 것이다.들어가는 글과 저작 개요제1권. 노동생산력 향상의 원인과, 노동생산력에서 나오는 생산물이 각각의 계층에서 자연 분배되는 질서제1장. 노동 분업

서울 쪽방 탐사 대기록
대도시는 어떻게 먹이사슬망이 되었나
쪽방에 들어가는 순간 생은 늪이 된다이 책은 르포다. 기자 정신으로 잠입해 취재를 하고, 하나의 단서를 잡으면 문어발식으로 확장해 증거를 수집해나간다. 사회부 소속으로 경찰서를 출입하는 일은 ‘사망’ ‘빈곤’ ‘불법’ 등 중요한 사회 문제를 사건의 발생과 종결로만 보게끔 시야를 제한시킨다. 그래서 저자는 기획취재부로 옮겼다. 이제 기자 신분임을 숨기고 지방에서 올라온 자취생 혹은 부동산 투기꾼으로 가장해 쪽방촌에 대한 정보를 수집해나간다. 그러자 서울 대도시 밑바닥층의 빈곤 문제가 하나의 비즈니스처럼 체계적인 이윤 추구 행위에 둘러싸여 있음이 드러났다.이 책은 작은 자서전이기도 하다. 부산 출신의 저자는 서울로 진학하면서 대학 시절 내내 주거빈곤자로 불안한 생활을 했다. 기숙사, 하숙, 반지하 원룸, LH 매입임대 주택, 산동네 분리형 원룸, LH 대학생 전세자금대출이 저자가 거쳐온 주거 역사다. 사회생활을 하면서는 가난한 과거사를 숨겼다. 요즘 가난은 훌륭한 서사의 자원이 되기도 하지만, 악바리 같은 부정적 이미지를 심어줘 불리한 약점이 될 우려가 있기 때문이다. 하지만 취재 과정에서 만난 청년 세대들이 자신이 직면한 빈곤을 외면하자 저자는 그들의 이야기를 끌어내기 위해 오히려 자신의 주거 빈곤사와 가난의 경험을 적극 드러내게 됐다. 그런 면에서 이 책은 가난에 대한 한 사람의 시선이 바뀌고 넓어지는 성장담이기도 하다.수많은 빈자, 중간 착취자, 소유주가 이 책에 등장한다. 실명을 밝히기도 하고 가명 처리한 인물도 있다. 위험을 무릅쓰고 빈곤의 실태를 이야기해준 사람들이다. 그들은 쪽방에 한번 발을 담갔다가 죽을 때까지 빠져나오지 못하는 절망에 대하여 증언했다. 바로 서울 동자동, 창신동, 사근동 주민들이다.들어가며1부 지옥고 아래 쪽방 ‘현대판 쪽방’ 고시원 사람들

유튜브 조회 수 300만 왕따였던 어른들 무삭제 인터뷰집2019년 4월 유튜브에는 왕따였던 어른들 Stop Bullying이라는 제목의 시리즈 영상 2편이 올라왔다. 학창 시절 ‘왕따’를 당했던 끔찍한 기억을 여린 몸에 새긴 채 그대로 어른으로 커 버린 이들 10명이 모여 각자 자기 경험담을 털어 놓는 방식의 이 인터뷰 영상물들은 순식간에 조회 수 300만 회를 넘기며 큰 반향을 불러일으켰다. 성원에 힘입어 2편의 영상물이 더 제작되었고 이 시리즈는 6개월여가 지난 지금까지 누적 조회 수 300만 회를 기록하며 더 많은 이들에게 퍼져 나가고 있다.『나의 가해자들에게』는 바로 이 영상물에 담긴 인터뷰 전문을 다듬어 실은 책이다. 영상물들의 재생 시간은 다 합쳐 20여 분 남짓이지만, 실제 진행된 인터뷰는 5시간을 훌쩍 넘었다. 어디서도 들을 수 없는 값진 이야기를 이대로 버리기는 아깝다는 판단에, 책으로 출간하게 된 것. 여기에 영상이 나가고 나서의 삶을 담담히 풀어 놓는 10명의 후일담을 담아 단행본으로서의 가치를 높였다.우리는 흔히 학교 폭력 문제를 10대 시절의 일로만 생각하지만, 사실 이 기억은 지독한 트라우마가 되어 어른이 된 후에도 지속적인 영향을 끼치기 쉽다. 이 책은 바로 이런 점에서 학교 폭력 문제를 전혀 새로운 시선으로 조명한 최초의 책이라 할 수 있다. 또한 실제로 왕따를 당했던 이들이 날것 그대로 전하는 생생한 이야기는 독자들에게 왕따가 실제로 얼마나 심각한 문제인지 확실히 인식시키는 한편, 같은 아픔으로 고민하는 청소년들에게 더없는 공감과 위로가 되어줄 것이다.시작하기 전에

_「사랑의 방」 부분“한국 최고의 연애 시집”(황현산)이라는 찬사를 받은 유진목 시인의 첫 시집 『연애의 책』을 문학동네포에지 57번으로 새롭게 복간한다. 『연애의 책』은 2016년, 시집 한 권 분량의 시를 투고받아 검토한 다음 펴내는 삼인시집선 1번으로 세상에 처음 선을 보인 바 있다. 평론가 황현산과 시인 김정환, 김혜순 세 선정위원의 3년여에 걸친 엄밀한 선정과정의 첫 열매였다. 유진목 시인은 문예지나 신춘문예에서 몇 편의 시를 발표하며 등단한 것이 아닌 처음부터 완결된 고유한 한 권의 세계로 등장한 것이다. 초판 해설을 쓴 조재룡 평론가에 따르면 유진목 시인은 사랑의 자취와 행위, 그 순간 피어오르는 제 마음을 적는 데 몰입하는 것처럼 보인다. 시인은 그가 지나온 ‘저기-삶’을 ‘여기-현실’로 붙들어 매며 장면과 장면(scene)에 밴 사랑의 자국과 상흔을 탁월하게 연출해낸다. 그의 시가 우리에게 내비추어 보여주는 것은 삶의 슬퍼서 찬란한 어둠이고, 삶의 저 즐거워서 컴컴한 빛이다. 그는 상징을 어루만지며, 타인을 호명하는 방식에 각별한 의미를 부여한다. 그렇게 ‘그리움’이라고 부르기에 부족한, 그 어떤 말로도 표현하기 어려운, 특이하고도 독특한 시적 순간을 연애의 사건으로 시로 만들어낸다. 이렇게 아직 우리에게 존재하지 않았던 연애시는 도착한다. 어느새 우리를 다른 곳으로 데려다놓고, 다른 곳을 보게 하는, 그런 시를.(조재룡)우리 이제 뭐할까

더 깊어진 통찰과 한층 풍부해진 경험으로 돌아오다!
“선택에 후회를 남기고 싶지 않을 때
우리에겐 역사가 필요하다“5년 연속 역사 베스트셀러, 국립어린이청소년도서관 ‘청소년추천도서’, 예스24 ‘올해의 책’, 경남·청주·양주 등 전국 지자체 ‘올해의 책’ 등 대한민국에 쓸모 열풍을 불러일으켰던 《역사의 쓸모》가 새로운 이야기로 돌아왔다. 신간 《다시, 역사의 쓸모》는 대한민국 대표 역사 커뮤니케이터 최태성이 지난 5년간 새롭게 발굴한 역사의 쓸모를 담은 책으로 ‘역사를 배워야 하는 이유’에 답했던 전작에서 한 걸음 더 나아가 ‘삶에 역사의 지혜를 들여오는 방법’을 다룬다.700만 명의 가슴을 울린 명강의의 주인공답게 최태성은 수백 년 전 일에 생명을 불어넣고 현대에도 유효한 의미를 찾아 친절하게 풀어내는 탁월한 이야기 솜씨를 발휘한다. 여기에 그간 더 깊고 예리해진 시선과 한층 풍부해진 경험을 더한 《다시, 역사의 쓸모》는 지식을 넘어 삶과 세상을 탐구하는 도구로서 역사를 활용하는 품격 있는 역사 사용법을 소개하며 독자들을 다시 한번 역사의 쓸모 세계로 초대한다.그 어느 때보다 사회 변화가 빠른 시대에 우리에게 절실한 것은 삶의 기준을 바로 세워줄 무언가다. 한두 달만 지나도 낡은 것이 되어버리는 쏟아지는 정보들 대신 수백 년의 시간이 검증한 역사의 통찰에 몸을 기대어 보면 어떨까? 세상에 휩쓸리지 않고 후회 없는 선택을 하며 살아가고 싶은 이들을 위해 《다시, 역사의 쓸모》는 역사에서 찾은 시간이 지나도 변하지 않는 단단한 가치들을 담아냈다. 여전히 인간다운 삶의 쓸모를 고민하는 사람이라면 이 책에서 ‘한 번의 인생, 어떻게 살아야 하는가’에 대한 답을 찾을 수 있을 것이다.|들어가는 글| 시간이 지나도 변하지 않는 가치를 찾는 일1장 | 다시, 역사를 찾는 이유평범한 내가 역사의 주인공이 되는 순간

플라스틱으로 뒤덮인 세상에 대한 어느 평범한 가족의 유쾌한 반란이 시작된다!우리는 화학물질의 바다에서 살고 있지만, 일상적으로 쓰는 수많은 플라스틱과 비닐의 성분이 무엇인지, 그것이 구체적으로 건강과 환경에 어떤 영향을 미치는지 잘 모른다. 그리고 그 ‘알 수 없다’는 인식과 ‘나쁜 건 알지만 안 쓸 수가 없다’는 체념은 곧 ‘어쩔 수 없으니 그냥 쓰자’는 무감한 행동으로 이어지곤 한다. ‘정말로 모른 척 넘어가도 되는 걸까?’라는 찜찜한 마음을 안고.이런 우리와 다를 바 없던, 그저 쓰레기 분리배출은 잘한다고 스스로 우쭐해하던 보통의 가족이 감히 ‘플라스틱 없이 한 달 살아 보기’에 도전했다! 그들은 왜 이런 실험을 감행하게 되었을까? 이 플라스틱이 넘쳐나는 세상에서 제대로 먹고살 수나 있었을까? 이 책 『우리는 플라스틱 없이 살기로 했다』는 충분히 예상 가능한 엄청난 역경과 시행착오를 거치면서도 재미있고 유쾌하게 ‘플라스틱 없이 살기’를 해나간 산드라 가족의 좌충우돌 실험 보고서다.이들 가족의 이야기를 따라가다 보면, 넘쳐나는 플라스틱이 왜 문제인지, 우리의 건강과 환경에 어떻게 영향을 미치는지, 왜 재활용 시스템만을 믿어서는 안 되는지 등 우리 삶과 환경의 관계를 바라보는 새로운 시야를 얻게 된다. 그리고 ‘나도 이 정도는 해볼 수 있겠다’는 용기와 아이디어를 얻을 수 있다. 작은 모래알이라도 모이면 더 큰 변화를 일으킬 수 있다.추천의 말

· 2030을 상담해온 심리학자가 제시하는, 방황하는 어린 어른을 위한 영혼의 지도
· 대상화된 ‘MZ세대’를 대체할, 생애 주기 분석에 입각한 심리학적 이름 ‘쿼터라이프’
· ‘안정형’과 ‘의미형’, 서로 다른 모두가 결핍을 메우기 위해 고군분투하는 시기
· 국내 최고 트라우마 상담가 김태경 교수, 영화 〈벌새〉 김보라 감독 강력 추천팬데믹 이후 더 두드러지게 보이는 현상 가운데 하나는, 20대 정신건강에 대한 위기가 표면으로 드러났다는 점이다. 한국의 20대, 30대의 사망 원인 1위는 ‘자살’이며 이제 숨길 수 없는 문제가 되었다. 그럼에도 사회는 여전히 20대에게 이중적인 시선을 보낸다. ‘가장 좋을 때’라거나 ‘청춘’이라는 낭만적인 말로 그들을 표현하거나 ‘MZ세대’처럼 기성세대와 다른 특별한 특성을 부여하는 듯하면서 본질적으로는 마케팅 용어로서 그들을 대상화한다. 이 책은 자신이 통제할 수 없는, 어른의 무게를 처음 마주한 2030대의 이야기를 한다. 안개처럼 흐릿하지만 무거운 중력, 어린 시절 무한한 가능성은 현실에 맞게 작아진다는 사실을 인정해야 하는 시기, 하지만 동시에 내가 잘하는 게 있을 것이라는 가능성에 대한 작은 희망. 그리고 용기 없는 나에게 누군가 나타나 이 세계에서 나의 가능성을 길어 올려주길 바라는 그 마음들. 방황하는 그 마음을 위한 책이다.청소년기를 통과했지만 아직도 방황과 고민으로 가득한 성인들의 마음을 놀랍도록 잘 담아낸 이 책은 이 시기에 겪게 되는 보편적인 방황과 고민에 대해 따뜻한 분석을 건넨다. 이제 성인이 되었으니 알아서 잘하라며 사회는 등을 떠밀지만, 20대, 30대를 맞은 당사자들의 마음은 앞이 잘 보이지 않는 막막한 괴로움과 서툰 방황으로 가득하다. 이는 시대와 지역을 막론하고 역사적으로 매우 보편적인 현상이다.융 심리학에 영향을 받은 심리학자인 저자는 가장 먼저 그들의 ‘심리학적’인 이름을 되찾는 일부터 시작한다. 아이도 아니고 어른도 아닌 생의 1/4 지점, ‘쿼터라이프’라는 생애 주기를 지정하고, 이 시기를 변하지 않는 심리적 단계로 구분하여, 그들의 방황과 고민을 위한 정확한 지도를 전달한다. 심리학을 넘어 이 세대의 문제에 접근하는 저자의 통찰력 있는 시각, 흡입력 있는 필치가 책의 깊이를 더한다. 상담심리학자인 저자는 실제 상담에서 접한 수많은 젊은이들의 사례 중에서도 가장 생생하면서도 핵심적이고 보편적인 부분을 효과적으로 재구성해 마치 캐릭터처럼 보여주며, 그들이 온전한 나를 찾고 세상으로 나아가는 과정을 드러낸다. 너무나 내 마음 같은 수많은 이야기 속에서 독자는 이들 깊은 내면에 자리한 장애물에 대한 탐색과 해결 과정에 함께 참여하게 된다. MBTI에 친숙한 독자라면 ‘안정형’과 ‘의미형’이 각각 고민하고 분투하는 과정에 대해서도 더욱 직관적으로 이해할 수 있을 것이다.마치 ‘영혼의 지도’를 따라 찾아가는 듯한 이 온전한 스토리텔링을 따라가다 보면 독자는 온전한 자기 이해와 삶 속으로 함께 걸어 나가는 경험을 할 수 있다. 방황하는 이 시대의 2030에게 이 책은 현대적 융 심리학이 제시할 수 있는 어쩌면 가장 온전하고 안전한 지도일지도 모른다.머리말: 어른의 무게가 보이지 않는 중력처럼 무겁게 느껴질 때1부 생의 1/4, 정의되지 않은 이름 없는 시기1장 20대는 눈부시다는 거짓말: 왜 누구도 이 고통에 대해서 말하지 않을까?
2장 누군가는 걸어온 길: 그들은 언제나 방향을 잃고, 잃고, 찾았다
3장 지금보다 더 나은 삶: 방황을 끝낼 안전한 지도가 우리에게 있다면2부 어른의 무게를 넘어4장 의미형
5장 안정형
6장 분리

정신과 의사 ‘윤답장’ 선생의 자존감 셀프 코칭법자존감 전문가이자 정신과 의사인 윤홍균 원장이 2년 넘게 심혈을 기울여 쓴 책으로, 자존감이 우리 삶에 미치는 영향을 친절하게 알려주고, 자존감을 끌어올리는 실질적인 방법을 알려주는 책. 높은 자존감을 갖고 싶지만 방법을 모르는 사람, 낮은 자존감 때문에 내면의 불화와 갈등을 겪고 있는 이들이 건강한 자존감을 회복하도록 돕는다.틈만 나면 뭔가를 배우고 열심인데 늘 결핍감에 시달리는 사람, 겸손과 배려가 넘쳐 자존감까지 떨어진 사람, 작은 말에도 쉽게 상처받는 사람, 상대의 반응이 두려워 눈치보는 사람, 사랑과 이별의 과정이 유난히 힘든 사람, 진짜 원하는 것이 뭔지 헷갈려 엉뚱한 곳에 에너지를 쏟는 사람, 감정과 싸우느라 에너지가 쉽게 고갈되는 사람, 결국 이런 모습이 싫어 자신을 사랑하지 못한 채 살아가는 사람들이 보면 크게 도움을 받을 수 있는 책이다.다양한 칼럼과 방송을 통해 ‘윤답장’ 선생으로 유명한 저자는 “나도 뒤처지는 기분, 포기하고 싶은 마음, 중독에 빠져 희망을 놓고 싶은 충동에 사로잡히곤 했다”고 고백하며, 자신이 그랬듯 더 많은 사람들이 자존감을 회복해 건강한 삶을 살길 바라는 마음을 담아 이 책을 펴냈다.저자는 자존감을 회복하는 과정을 자전거 타기에 비유하고 있다.“우리는 자존감에 올라타 중심을 잡고 살아야 할 운명인데, 자존감은 자전거처럼 쉴 새 없이 움직인다. 이 책은 자존감이라는 자전거를 타는 법을 알려주고, 넘어지지 않고 오래 타는 법, 안전하게 넘어지는 법, 착용해야 할 보호장비에 대해서 알려준다.” “자전거를 타는 동안 우리는 분명 한두 번 넘어질 것이다. 자전거를 배운 지 30년이 넘은 사람도 가끔 넘어지고 깨지는 이치와 같다. 하지만 자전거를 일으켜 다시 올라탈 줄 알며, 상처를 치료할 줄 아는 사람은 더 이상 자전거를 두려워하지 않는다. 오히려 자주 타고 싶고, 애용하며, 즐기게 될 것이다”.Prologue 문제는 자존감이다Part1 자존감이 왜 중요한가1 자존감의 세 가지 축

★★★2023년 교육청 선정 도서, 청소년이 선정한 추천 도서
★★★2024년 10여 지자체·대학교 ‘올해의 책’ 선정윤정은 작가의 베스트셀러 소설 『메리골드 마음 세탁소』가 100쇄 돌파와 영국·미국 동시 출간을 기념하여 ‘버블 에디션’으로 새롭게 출간된다. 지금까지 일본, 중국, 프랑스, 이탈리아, 브라질을 포함한 해외 10개국에 출간되고 20개국에 판권이 계약된 『메리골드 마음 세탁소』는 출간 1년 7개월여 만에 ‘K-힐링’의 독보적 위치에서 한국 문학을 대표하는 작품 중 하나가 되었다. 펭귄랜덤하우스를 통해 출간된 영미판은 영국의 시사주간지 《이코노미스트》에서도 주목할 만큼 해외의 독자들과 언론의 관심을 받고 있다. 세계 각국에 지점을 두고 운영되는 서점 ‘키노쿠니야’ 싱가포르에서 종합순위 1위를 기록하기도 했다. 국내에서도 2024년 전국 각지의 지자체와 대학교의 ‘올해의 책’으로 선정되면서, 여전히 마음을 울리는 문학 테라피로 독자들의 사랑을 입증하고 있다.세계적으로 한국 힐링 소설의 폭발적 인기를 견인하고 있는 『메리골드 마음 세탁소』가 국내 독자들을 위해 새롭게 선보이는 ‘버블 에디션’은 펭귄랜덤하우스의 영미판 표지에서 재탄생되었다. 매일 일기예보를 살피어 맑은 날, 흐린 날, 춥지도 덥지도 않은 어떤 날들이 우리 앞에 당도할 때 불현듯 놀라지 않을 수 있도록, 힘든 순간에도 곧 좋은 날이 올 거라고, 인생의 일기예보처럼 마음을 편안하게 해주는 소설 『메리골드 마음 세탁소』와 함께 웃고, 궁금해하고, 성장하는 시간을 선물하기에도 제격이다.우리는 가끔 시간을 되돌려 과거로 돌아가 후회됐던 일을 되돌리고 싶어 한다. 그런데 과연 그 일을 지워버리는 게 현명한 선택일까? 그리고 그 기억을 지웠을 때 지금의 내가 있을 수 있을까? 만약 그 기억만 없다면 앞으로 행복만 할 수 있을까? 『메리골드 마음 세탁소』는 한밤중 언덕 위에 생겨난, 조금 수상하고도 신비로운 세탁소에서 벌어지는 일들을 그린 힐링 판타지 소설이다. 창백하게 하얀 얼굴에 젓가락처럼 마른 몸, 까맣고 구불구불 긴 머리의 미스테리한 여자는 세탁소를 찾아오는 누군가를 위해 매일같이 따뜻한 차를 끓인다. 차를 마신 이들은 어느 누구에게도 말하지 못했던 비밀스러운 이야기들을 자기도 모르게 그녀에게 털어놓는다. 아픈 날의 기억을 얼룩 지우듯 모조리 깨끗이 지워달라고 부탁한 사람들은 과연 세탁소를 나서며 행복해질 수 있을까?『하고 싶은 대로 살아도 괜찮아』를 비롯해 약 50만 독자들에게 큰 사랑을 받아온 윤정은 작가가 문학상 수상 이후 11년 만에 출간한 장편소설 『메리골드 마음 세탁소』은 조용한 마을에 마법처럼 등장한 세탁소를 배경으로 펼쳐진다. 우연히 세탁소를 찾아온 사람들의 갖가지 사연과 속 깊은 대화를 통해 세탁소 주인 ‘지은’의 내면에 찾아오는 변화를 따뜻한 시선으로 그려냈다. 가난에 시달려 꿈을 포기한 어린 시절, 사랑했던 연인의 배신, 부와 명예에 홀려 놓쳐버린 삶, 학교 폭력으로 인한 상처와 방황, 자식을 위해 몸 바쳐 보낸 청춘 등 우리 각자의 삶을 닮은 이야기가 마음을 울린다. 상처를 인정하고 마음을 열어 보이는 용기와, 이웃의 아픔에 공감하고 상처를 위로하는 따뜻한 마음이 작품 전반에 진하게 녹아 있다. 이 책 『메리골드 마음 세탁소』는 벼랑 끝에 몰린 것 같은 어느 날, 마음 같은 건 없었으면 좋겠다고 생각되는 그런 날에 숨어들어 상처를 털어낼 수 있는 은신처가 되어줄 것이다.메리골드 마음 세탁소 009

삶의 축복과 기적에 바치는 최상의 찬사!『연금술사』 『순례자』를 비롯한 여러 작품을 통해 전 세계 3억 2천만 독자의 마음을 움직인 우리 시대 가장 사랑받는 작가 파울로 코엘료의 장편소설 『베로니카, 죽기로 결심하다』가 새 옷을 입고 선보인다. 열정 없는 삶에 빠져 꿈을 잃어버리고 자살을 시도했다가 정신병원에서 눈을 뜬 베로니카의 이야기를 그린 이 소설은 1998년 브라질에서 처음 출간된 이후 50개 언어로 번역되어 25년 가까이 전 세계에서 꾸준한 사랑을 받았고, 소설을 원작으로 한 동명의 영화가 미국과 일본에서 각각 제작되고 소설 내용이 모티프가 된 밴드곡이 작곡되는 등 또다른 창작에 영감을 주며 다양한 예술의 형태를 통해 독자들을 만났다. 특히 전 세계가 감염병의 공포에 내몰렸던 ‘코로나 시대’에는 『연금술사』와 함께 작가의 책 중 전 세계적으로 가장 높은 판매고를 기록하며 앞이 보이지 않는 절망 속에서도 다시금 살아갈 용기를 건네는 이야기의 힘을 또 한번 확인하게 했다.인생에는 우리를 파괴하든, 강하게 만들든 둘 중 하나의 결과만이 나오는 싸움이 있다. 정신병원 입원도 그중 하나다. 그 기이하고 극단적인 환경에서 얻은 것이 있다면 완전한 자유였다. 나를 남들과 똑같이 만들려는 가족의 모든 노력은 정확히 반대의 결과를 낳았다. 이제 나는 또래의 모든 청년들과 완벽히 달랐다. _파울로 코엘료『피에트라 강가에서 나는 울었네』 『악마와 미스 프랭』과 함께 ‘그리고 일곱번째 날’ 3부작에 속하는 이 소설은 작가로서 35주년을 맞이한 ‘영혼의 연금술사’ 파울로 코엘료의 경험이 직접 반영된 작품이기도 하다. 당장 세상을 떠나려 했지만 예기치 않게 허락된 일주일의 유예기간 동안 생의 열정을 다시 발견한 베로니카의 모습에는 수차례 정신병원에 격리 수용되었던 작가의 젊은 시절이 고스란히 담겨 있고, 스스로의 삶 깊은 곳에서 길어낸 경험과 성찰은 더욱 진솔하게 다가오며 깊은 울림을 전한다.undefined]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/books/베로니카-죽기로-결심하다.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/베로니카 죽기로 결심하다.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[파울로 코엘료, 이상해]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 17:08:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[데미안]]></title><description><![CDATA[undefined

피할 수 없는 사랑의 행복과 상처에 관한 이야기 「첫사랑」 외 2편톨스토이, 도스토예프스키와 함께 러시아 문학의 3대 거장으로 손꼽히는 투르게네프의 대표작. 한 여자를 사이에 둔 아버지와 아들의 삼각관계를 투르게네프 특유의 부드럽고 섬세한 필치로 그려 내고 있으며, 등장인물들의 탁월한 심리 및 성격 묘사가 돋보이는 작품이다. 「첫사랑」 외에도 1840년대 모순과 갈등으로 혼란한 러시아 사회에서 방황하는 귀족 출신 젊은이들의 사랑과 좌절을 그린 「귀족의 보금자리」, 벙어리이자 귀머거리 농노와 그가 사랑한 강아지에 대한 감동적인 이야기 「무무」가 함께 수록되어 있다.첫사랑

일본 아마존 자기계발 베스트셀러
토스트마스터즈 일본 콘테스트 68회 수상자의 비법 대공개
일한 만큼 인정받고 싶은 일잘러를 위한 필독서말 잘하는 사람은 이야기가 논리적이라는 공통점이 있다. 논리적인 깔끔한 말은 상대를 보기 좋게 설득하고, 내가 원하는 것을 얻게 해주며, 때로는 무논리인 상대의 입에 재갈을 물린다. 그래서 누구나 논리적으로 말하기를 배우고 싶어 하지만 단기간 훈련만으로는 쉽지 않다. 이번에 출간된 『당신도 논리적으로 말할 수 있습니다』는 스피치 대회인 토스트마스터즈 일본 콘테스트에서 68회 입상하고, 1위를 포함해 전국 챔피언 자리로 일본 내 최고 기록을 가진 저자가 논리적 말하기 공식인 ‘PREP 기법’을 상세히 소개한 책이다.PREP(프렙)은 결론(Point), 이유(Reason), 사례(Example), 요약(Point)의 머리글자를 따서 만든 말하기 기법이다. 하고자 하는 이야기의 결론을 먼저 말하고(P), 그에 대한 이유(R)와 사례(E)를 제시한 다음 마지막에 다시 한 번 요약(P)하는 방법이다. 고객에게 물건을 팔 때, 상사에게 보고하거나 회의에서 안건을 발표할 때, 면접 볼 때 등 상대방을 논리적으로 설득하고 싶을 때 PREP 기법은 하나의 공식처럼 간편하게 활용할 수 있다. 특히 일한 만큼 인정받고 싶은 일잘러에겐 필독서다. “결론이 뭔가?”라는 질문에 막힘없이 논리적으로 답할 수 있는 가장 구체적이고 편리한 방법이기 때문이다.“논리적으로 말하는 방법에 대해 자신 있게 추천할 수 있는 책을 만났다.” 우리나라 최고의 생각정리 컨설턴트인 생각정리클래스의 복주환 대표는 이 책을 강력추천하며 기꺼이 감수자로서 나섰다. 복 대표는 평소 ‘논리적 사고와 말하기 기술’에 관해 묻는 사람들에게 딱 한 가지 방법만 소개한다면 PREP 기법을 추천한다. 그런 면에서 이 책은 PREP 기법에 대해 가장 일목요연하게 정리되어 있고, 원리도 쉽게 설명되어 있는 ‘비즈니스 커뮤니케이션 분야 최고의 실용서’라고 추천 이유를 밝혔다.추천의 글. 논리적 말하기에도 공식이 있습니다

조선, 동아, 한겨레, 서울, 한국에 소개된 책!
서울대 학생이 많이 읽은 도서 20 선정!온전하고 자유로운 삶을 위한
쇼펜하우어의 독한 가르침“인간의 불행 중 상당수는
혼자 있을 수 없어서 생기는 일이다”쇼펜하우어는 니체의 철학, 헤세와 카프카의 문학, 프로이트와 융의 심리학에 지대한 영향을 끼친, 19세기 서양 철학계의 상징적인 인물이다. 그는 “인생은 의미가 없다. 그러므로 태어나지 않는 것이 최선이고, 태어났다면 최대한 빨리 죽는 것이 차선이다.”라고 말해 흔히 염세주의자로 알려졌지만, 그 어떤 철학자, 작가보다 치열하게 살았다. 이 책은 『당신의 인생이 왜 힘들지 않아야 한다고 생각하십니까』가 출간 6개월 만에 독자들의 사랑을 받으며 10만 부 돌파 베스트셀러가 된 것을 기념해 펴낸 스페셜 에디션이다.쇼펜하우어가 세상을 떠난 지 150년의 세월이 흘렀지만, 우리가 오늘날까지 쇼펜하우어를 기억하고 그가 남긴 저서에서 인생의 해답을 찾으려는 이유가 뭘까? 그것은 쇼펜하우어가 인생 그 자체를 텍스트 삼아 삶의 고통을 철학으로 승화시켰기 때문이다. 인생은 고통이며, 고통은 집착에서 비롯되고, 따라서 집착을 버림으로써 우리는 고통의 소멸에 이를 수 있다는 ‘비관에 대한 비관’을 제시했기 때문이다. 그래서 그의 철학은 행복해지고 싶어서 결국 불행해져 버린 현대인들에게 시사하는 바가 크다.쇼펜하우어는 일평생 열한 권의 책을 썼고, 그중 생전에 출판된 저서는 여덟 권이다. 괴테를 비롯한 수많은 사람과 편지를 주고받았고, 1만 페이지가 넘는 일기를 거의 하루도 빼놓지 않고 썼다. 『당신의 인생이 왜 힘들지 않아야 한다고 생각하십니까』는 그의 도서들과 편지, 일기 등에서 쇼펜하우어의 삶에 대한 통찰과 정곡을 찌르는 인생 조언을 모아 엮은 책이다. 쇼펜하우어를 알고 있는 사람도, 알지 못했던 사람도 이 책을 읽게 되는 순간, 옛 철학자의 독설 안에 감춰진 열망과 투지를 느낄 수 있을 것이다.편역자의 글
쇼펜하우어의 글1부나는 ‘나’로서 존재한다
다수는 그저 많은 숫자일 뿐, 많다고 정의가 되는 건 아니다
산책의 동료는 ‘고뇌’로 족하다
나만 힘들고, 나만 피곤하고, 나만 희생당한다는 착각
현명할수록 명예와 체면이 얼마나 가벼운 것인지를 안다
누구나 자신의 산에 오르기를 꿈꾼다
늙음의 덧없음
인생에서 ‘죽음’보다 확실한 것은 없다
부모는 자녀를 개인으로 바라봐주지 않는다
가진 자에게도, 다스리는 자에게도 ‘장수’는 징계다
판단을 타인에게 의존하지 말라
우리가 사소한 일에 위로받는 이유는 사소한 일에 고통받기 때문이다2부행복이란 단어를 제거하면 행복할 수 있다
신의 은총에 인생을 던지고 싶지 않다
내가 강해질수록 나는 더욱 치명적인 상처를 입는다
자신이 증오스러울 땐 자는 것이 최고다
‘사유’를 통해 인간은 인간다워진다
인간의 불행 중 상당수는 혼자 있을 수 없어서 생기는 일이다
나는 왜 다른 사람의 판단에 휘말리는 것일까?
아파하고 싶지 않다면 아픔과 친해져야 한다
우정을 우연에 맡겨서는 안 된다
죽음이 오기 전까지 최선을 다하고 싶다
정신적으로 성숙해지려면 마흔 살은 되어야 한다
‘사람들이 원하는 나’로 평생을 살 수는 없다3부왜 주님이라는 자는 항상 분노하고 계시는가
잘못된 독서는 나쁜 친구와 어울리는 것보다 나쁘다
권태는 언제나 우리 등 뒤에 서 있다
소유는 만족이 아니라, 의무의 시작이다
나보다 비참한 자들이 나를 행복하게 해준다
교육의 궁극적 목표는 성장이 아닌 ‘개조’에 있다
정신적으로 성숙한 사람일수록 감성이 극도로 예민하다
인간의 성격은 어떻게 만들어지는가
적과 동지를 구별하는 가장 좋은 방법
인간을 불평분자로 만드는 악당
불행이 터졌을 때보다 불행이 지나간 후가 더 중요하다
보잘것없는 재능으로 너무 많은 것을 얻었다4부그대의 오늘은 최악이었다, 내일은 오늘보다 더 나쁠지도 모른다
범죄자를 위한 사회의 헌신은 공짜가 아니다
가진 자들의 머릿속에는 노동자들에게 더 많은 노동을 전가하는 계획밖에 없다
대체 왜 우리는 노력하는가, 왜 청춘은 꿈을 꾸는가
세계관은 소년 시절에 완성된다

‘부자 아빠 가난한 아빠’ 20주년 기념
업그레이드 에디션 출간!
세계 금융 변화에 맞춘 41개의 NEW 코멘트
토론과 실천을 위한 10가지 스터디세션 등 500매 분량의 내용 추가
1997년 미국에서 처음 출간된 이래 전 세계 51가지 언어로 109개국에서 출판되어 4000만 부(국내 350만 부)가 판매된 경제경영 재테크 분야 최고의 밀리언셀러 ‘부자 아빠 가난한 아빠’ 시리즈. 20년의 세월을 통해 검증된 부자들의 돈과 투자에 대한 지침들과 오늘날의 시대상에 맞춘 새로운 정보들이 추가된 『부자 아빠 가난한 아빠 20주년 특별 기념판』이 ㈜민음인에서 출간되었다. 지난 20년간 독자들에게 가장 많은 사랑을 받아 온 『부자 아빠 가난한 아빠 1』의 내용에 세계 금융 변화에 맞춘 41개의 ‘20년 전 그리고 오늘’과 토론과 실천을 위한 10가지 ‘스터디세션’ 등 원고지 500매 분량이 추가된 업그레이드 에디션이다. 돈에 대한 선입관을 깨뜨리는 파격적인 내용과 세월이 흘러도 변치 않는 투자의 원칙들은, 비트코인 광풍, 부동산 경매 시장의 활기 등 다양한 양상의 투자에 대한 관심이 높아지고 있는 오늘날에도 여전히 ‘돈’과 ‘투자’의 흔들리지 않는 기준이 되어 줄 것이다.무엇보다 이 책이 독자들에게 파고든 이유는 돈에 대한 일반적인 상식을 뒤집었기 때문이다. 저자는 사람들이 가난한 이유는 돈이 없어서가 아니라, 돈을 금기시하며 금융 지식을 멀리하는 사고와 문화 때문이라고 말한다. 저자의 가난한 아버지는 공부를 많이 했지만, 늘 카드대금 청구서와 주택융자금에 시달렸다.(“돈을 좋아하는 것은 모든 악의 근원이다. 공부 열심히 해서 좋은 직장을 구해야지. 위험을 피하고 안정적으로 살아라.”) 반면 친구의 부자 아버지는 정규 교육은 제대로 받지 못했지만 금융 IQ를 터득하여 막대한 부를 쌓았다.(“돈이 부족한 것은 모든 악의 근원이다. 공부 열심히 해서 좋은 회사를 차려라. 네가 똑똑한 사람을 고용해야 한다. 무엇보다 위험을 관리하는 법을 배워야 한다.”) 이 책에서는 저자가 유년 시절 겪은 두 아버지를 통해 가난한 사람과 부자의 사고방식을 비교한다. 직설적인 화법과 몰입도 있는 스토리텔링으로 경제에 대한 기초 상식은 물론, 자산과 부채의 개념과 성공적인 투자를 위한 금융 IQ를 기르는 비법 등을 누구나 이해할 수 있도록 쉽고 명쾌하게 전한다.20주년 기념 서문 | 20년이 지나도 변하지 않는 것들

개인 브랜딩 시대. 내가 쓰고 그리는 문장과 그림, 말투 등 나를 보여주는 것에는 여러 가지 도구가 있다. 한편 학교나 직장 안에서 나를 보여줄 수 있는 핵심 도구는 ‘파워포인트’이다. 파워포인트는 만능 재주꾼으로 발표할 때의 PPT는 나의 스피치를 돋보이게 만드는 반사판 역할을 하고, 보고를 위해 만드는 PPT 자료는 그간의 업무 성과를 가시적으로 보여주는 대변인이 되기도 한다. 취업과 이직을 위해 PPT로 만든 포트폴리오는 새로운 기회를 열어주는 열쇠가 된다. PC에는 다양한 프로그램이 설치되어 있지만 그중에서도 가장 쉽게 사용할 수 있고, 최대의 효과를 낼 수 있는 건 단연 PPT 프로그램이다.이제는 제안서, 회사 소개서, 카드뉴스 등도 포토샵이나 디자인 프로그램 없이 만들 수 있다. 이번에 새롭게 출간된 『새별의 심플한 PPT 디자인 노하우』에는 포토샵 없이도 다양한 콘텐츠를 만들 수 있는 ‘새별’만의 노하우가 담겨 있다. 전작 『새별의 파워포인트 디자인 수업』을 절판하고, 새로운 내용과 새로운 기술을 담은 이 책은 심플하고 간결한 PPT를 만들기 위해 필요한 방법을 단계별로 나누어 해설한다. 또한 전작에서는 볼 수 없었던 PPT 디자인의 Before &amp; After를 한눈에 볼 수 있게 담아, 내가 만든 PPT 디자인이 무엇이 부족하고, 어떤 걸 보충하면 완벽해지는지 알 수 있다. 그리고 실습 예제 파일과 새별표 컬러 팔레트, 다이어그램 50선을 특별 부록으로 담아 언제 어디서든 파워포인트 스킬을 업그레이드할 수 있다.서문

‘아는 자’가 ‘가진 자’가 되는 초정보·초연결·초디지털 시대,
최상의 퍼포먼스를 위한 최적의 프로세스

AI가 보고서를 쓰고 그림을 그리는 초기술시대, 정보를 생산하는 것이 인간에 국한되지 않는 오늘날 우리는 실시간으로 쏟아지고 동시에 사라지는 거대한 정보의 급류에 휩쓸리고 있다. 현대의 지식 과잉 사회에서는 단순히 정보를 많이 모으는 것이 성공을 담보하지 않으며, 자신의 업무에 유용한 자료를 선별하고 가공하여 재생산하는 것이 필수적인 능력이 된다. 하지만 여전히 많은 사람들이 맹목적으로 정보를 수집하고 저장하는 기초 단계에 머물러 있다. 심지어 자신이 자료를 갖고 있다는 사실조차 잊어버리고 비슷한 내용을 여기저기 담아두기도 한다. 이는 우리가 정보를 어떻게 선택하고 저장해야 하는지 기준을 명확히 알지 못하기 때문이다. 이 책은 정보의 홍수 속에 길을 잃고 헤매는 사람들에게 쉽고 간단하면서도 효율적인 정보 관리 방법인 PARA를 소개하고, 이의 구축과 실행, 활용 방법을 상세히 알려준다. PARA는 모든 자료를 단 4개의 범주로 구분하는 획기적인 시스템으로, 다니엘 핑크, 세스 고딘 등 세계적인 지식인과 혁신가들이 열광하고 극찬한 ‘세컨드 브레인’의 핵심 도구이다. 일과 일상의 모든 부분에서 생산성과 창의성을 높여주는 PARA를 통해 누구나 자신의 목표를 달성하고 성공을 향해 나아가게 될 것이다.들어가는 글 _ 정보의 목적은 저장이 아닌 실행이다1부 구축:PARA 이해하기1장 PARA는 무엇이 다른가

도덕적 규범에 짓눌린 한 여인의 모습을 상징적으로 그린 걸작청교도주의의 본고장인 17세기 보스턴을 무대로 삼은 이 소설은 늙은 남편에 앞서 바다를 건너온 헤스터가 젊은 목사와 사랑하는 사이가 되어 아기까지 갖자 간통죄라는 낙인이 찍히는 데서 시작한다. 애정의 삼각관계, 즉 불의의 남녀 관계를 다루는 듯하지만 작가 너새니얼 호손의 관심은 사랑의 곡절이 아니라 이것이 빚어내는 죄의식의 처리에 있다. 복수심의 노예로 타락해가는 남편, 착하나 의지가 약한 탓에 허위와 가책에 허덕이는 목사, 그를 끝내 감싸주며 안간힘을 다해 자신에게 주어진 삶의 고난에 맞서는 여인, 그리고 이들의 기구한 인연을 맺어주는 불의의 열매인 어린 딸, 이들 네 사람을 중심으로 호손은 죄와 벌의 문제를 끊임없이 분석해나간다.감옥 문

사내의 입에서 터져 나오는 괴성. 그리고 그의 몸은 점점 거대해져 갔다. 그의 피부는 이미 사람의 것이 아니었다. 마치 갑옷처럼 촘촘하게 엮어진 붉은 색의 비늘이 자라나고 있었고, 몸은 이제 사람의 몇 배 이상 거대해져 있었다. 천천히 그의 등을 뚫고 자라나는 붉은 날개. 그 날개의 웅장함이란 이루 말할 수가 없었다.undefined]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/books/주홍글씨.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/주홍글씨.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[나다니엘 호손, 조승국]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 17:02:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[카라마조프 가의 형제들 세트]]></title><description><![CDATA[undefinedundefined]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/books/카라마조프-가의-형제들-세트.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/카라마조프 가의 형제들 세트.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[표도르 도스토예프스키, 김연경]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 17:02:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[싯다르타]]></title><description><![CDATA[테스트 용 파일"싯다르타"는 고대 인도의 젊은 남자 싯다르타의 영적 여정을 다룬 소설입니다. 주인공 싯다르타는 자아를 찾기 위해 다양한 삶의 방식을 경험하며 성장합니다.
브라만의 아들 싯다르타는 존경받는 브라만 가문의 아들로 태어났으나, 전통적인 종교 교육과 생활에서 벗어나 진리를 찾기 위해 떠납니다. 사문과의 생활 친구 고빈다와 함께 고행 생활을 하는 사문이 되어 물질적 쾌락을 부정하고 명상을 통해 깨달음을 추구합니다. 고타마 붓다와의 만남 싯다르타는 고타마 붓다(석가모니)를 만나 가르침을 듣지만, 자신만의 길을 가기로 결심합니다. 고빈다는 붓다의 제자가 되지만, 싯다르타는 홀로 떠납니다. 카밀라와의 삶 싯다르타는 도시로 가서 매춘부 카밀라를 만나 사랑을 배우고, 상인 카마스와미에게서 물질적 성공을 배웁니다. 그러나 이 모든 것이 그에게 진정한 만족을 주지 못합니다. 강가의 깨달음 싯다르타는 강가에서 배를 젓는 배사공 바수데바를 만나 그의 단순한 삶을 통해 깊은 깨달음을 얻습니다. 결국, 그는 강을 통해 삶의 진정한 본질을 이해하게 됩니다. 영적 여정: 싯다르타의 삶은 자아를 찾기 위한 끝없는 탐구입니다.
자기 발견: 다른 사람들의 가르침이 아닌, 자신의 경험을 통해 깨달음을 얻는 것이 중요하다는 메시지를 전달합니다.
이원성의 초월: 세속적인 삶과 영적인 삶을 모두 경험하며 이 둘의 경계를 넘나드는 과정이 묘사됩니다. 영적 탐구와 철학: "싯다르타"는 동양 철학과 서양 철학을 통합한 헤세의 대표작으로, 많은 이들에게 영감과 깨달음을 주었습니다.
개인주의와 자아 실현: 싯다르타의 이야기는 현대 사회에서도 여전히 중요한 주제인 자기 발견과 자아 실현에 대해 깊이 생각하게 합니다.
문학적 가치: 아름다운 문체와 깊이 있는 철학적 성찰로 인해 세계 문학사에서 중요한 위치를 차지합니다. 철학과 영성에 관심 있는 독자: 자아 탐구와 영적 여정을 다룬 책을 찾는 독자에게 적합합니다.
자기 계발서 애호가: 자신의 삶의 의미를 찾고자 하는 사람들에게 큰 영감을 줄 수 있습니다.
문학 애호가: 헤르만 헤세의 문학적 재능과 아름다운 글쓰기를 경험하고 싶은 독자에게 추천합니다.

사람들의 마음속에서 디자인은 어떻게 받아들여질까?
끝까지 살아남는 디자인의 심리학적 조건을 파헤친다!어떤 디자인이 성공하고 어떤 디자인이 실패하는가? 그 답은 UX(사용자 경험)의 병목 현상에 있다. UX의 병목이란 디자인이 통과해야 할 사용자의 심리적 구간을 말한다. 이 책은 UX 디자인의 심리적 병목 구간을 밝혀낸 세계 최초의 안내서로, 사람들이 디자인을 심리적으로 어떻게 받아들이고 거부하는지를 흥미롭게 탐구한다. UX 전문가이자 심리학 박사인 저자는 마이크로소프트의 고객 리서치 수석 매니저로 활약하며, 오피스 365, 윈도우 10 등 마이크로소프트의 대표적 제품들의 디자인을 맡고 있으며 그동안 실무 경험에서 터득한 통찰을 이 책에서 모두 공개했다. 오랫동안 UX 이면의 심리를 연구해 온 저자는 이 책은 단편적인 법칙이 아니라 100년간의 심리학 분야의 연구 결과를 바탕으로 세계적으로 전파되고 많이 사용되는 디자인의 비밀을 밝혀낸다. 이 한 권의 책으로 UX 디자인을 해 나가는 데 필요한 모든 심리학 지식을 끝낼 수 있도록 탄탄하게 구성되어 있다.프롤로그1부 - 주의 병목 구간1장 중심와 시선

Answer: The assembly instructions are currently only available in Korean. We recognize the importance of making these accessible to our team in China and plan to have them translated into English as an intermediary step. This process is expected to take approximately one week. We will explore options for translation into Chinese to ensure clarity and accessibility for all team members involved in the assembly process. Question: Do we have visual aids, such as videos, to supplement the assembly instructions? Answer: At the moment, we do not have video documentation of the assembly process. However, we acknowledge the value of visual aids in enhancing understanding and reducing the potential for errors. We will initiate the creation of video tutorials that detail the assembly process, ensuring that these resources are comprehensive and easy to follow. Question: What specific assembly procedures are currently undertaken by the Korean CM, and are we fully aware of these processes? Answer: The Korean CM handles a range of assembly procedures that are documented in our standard operating procedures. However, it's essential to conduct a thorough review to ensure that all processes are fully captured and up-to-date. We are in the process of auditing these procedures to confirm their completeness and accuracy. Question: Considering the assembly procedures performed by the Korean CM, do we believe it's feasible to replicate these processes in China without significant obstacles? Answer: Based on our initial assessment, we believe that transitioning these assembly processes to China is feasible. The procedures do not require specialized skills that cannot be replicated or taught in China. However, we must ensure that all procedural documentation is current, translated, and adapted as necessary to meet any local regulatory requirements or operational differences. Question: Are there any anticipated challenges or limitations in transferring the assembly line to China, such as differences in regulations, standards, or workforce skills? Answer: While we anticipate a smooth transition overall, we are mindful of potential challenges such as differences in regulatory standards, the need for workforce training, and the adaptation of procedures to local practices. We are committed to conducting a detailed analysis to identify any such challenges early in the process and develop strategies to address them effectively. Question: What will be the approach if there are questions raised during the meeting that cannot be immediately answered? Answer: Should any questions arise that I cannot answer directly, I will take detailed notes and follow up with my direct manager to ensure a timely and accurate response. We are committed to transparency and effective communication throughout this transition process. It's clear from your preparation that while there are areas needing attention, such as the translation of documentation and the creation of visual aids, you have a proactive plan to address these needs. Emphasizing your commitment to a thorough review and update of assembly procedures, along with a strategic approach to overcoming potential challenges, will be key to reassuring the executives of the feasibility and readiness for the transition.Youcan you make it little bit easier? my mother tongue is korean, so some of that sentences are hard to memorize for me.ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Let's simplify the responses for your meeting: Question: Do we need to translate the assembly instructions? Are there videos? Answer: Yes, the instructions are only in Korean now. We need to translate them into English, which will take about a week. We don't have videos yet, but we plan to make them to help everyone understand the process better. Question: Can we use the same assembly procedures in China as in Korea? Answer: The procedures we use in Korea can be used in China too. We don't see big problems with moving the assembly there. Most tasks don't need special skills. But, we need to update and translate our instructions to make sure everyone can follow them. Question: What problems might we face moving to China? Answer: We might face some challenges, like different rules or the need to train the team in China. But we believe we can handle these by planning well and updating our instructions. Question: How long will it take to get all the documentation ready for the China team? Answer: We need about one week to translate the current documents into English. Making videos and further translations might take a bit more time. Question: Will the training materials be understandable for someone who doesn't speak Korean? Answer: Yes, we will translate everything into English first, and then into Chinese if needed, to make sure everyone can understand. Question: How do we ensure the quality of the assembly process remains high after moving to China? Answer: We will train the China team using our updated guides and videos. We will also check the assembly quality regularly. Question: Are there any parts of the assembly that must stay in Korea? Answer: Right now, we think everything can move to China. But we will double-check to make sure. Question: What is our timeline for moving the assembly line to China? Answer: We are still planning, but we will share a timeline as soon as we have it. Question: How will we handle differences in work culture between Korea and China? Answer: We will learn about the work culture in China and adapt our training and management to fit well with the team there. Question: Do we need any special permissions or certifications to start manufacturing in China? Answer: We are checking on this. We will get all the needed permissions and certifications before we start. Question: How will we transfer equipment and materials to China? Answer: We are planning the best way to do this. We will make sure everything is safe and cost-effective. Question: What if we face unexpected challenges during the move? Answer: We will plan carefully and have backup plans. We will solve problems as they come. Question: How will we communicate with the team in China? Answer: We will use English for official communication. We might also use translators when needed to make sure everyone understands. Question: Will there be ongoing support from Korea to the China team? Answer: Yes, we will keep supporting the China team. We can have regular meetings and visits to make sure everything goes well. Question: How will this move affect our delivery times to customers? Answer: We plan to keep delivery times the same, or even improve them by being closer to some of our customers. ]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/works/2024-02-05-question-of-hq.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Works/2024-02-05 Question of HQ.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:49:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[(리팩토링)Excel VBA_테이블 구조 변경 자동화]]></title><description><![CDATA[이전 버전의 VBA 코드(<a data-href="Excel VBA_테이블 구조 변경 자동화" href="https://64etuor.github.io/works/microsoft/excel-vba/excel-vba_테이블-구조-변경-자동화.html#_0" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Excel VBA_테이블 구조 변경 자동화</a>)는 말 그대로 데이터를 가져오는 범위가 셀 주소로 명시된 하드 코딩이었다. 그런데 시간이 지나니 생산 계획을 짜는 팀에서 테이블에 열도 추가하는 등의 수정을 했다. 당연히 올바른 셀 주소에서 값을 가져올 수 없으니 그대로 매크로를 실행한 엉뚱한 값을 가져올 것이다. 그러니 수정이 필요했다. 필요한 작업은,

생산 계획표의 열 이름에 뒤에 공백을 넣는 경우가 있었다.(Customer 값을 찾지 못하는 문제가 발생해서 보니 원본 열의 이름이 “Customer”가 아니라 “Customer “였다.) 그래서 Trim으로 앞뒤 공백을 제거하는 과정을 넣었다. 혹시 몰라 “Customer ”를 찾게 하는 코드도 추가했다.워낙 간단한 코드라서 큰 문제랄 건 없었다. 귀찮아서 리팩토링을 미루던 코드인데, 생성형 ai의 도움으로 순식간에 작업이 끝났다. 이제 사람이 코드를 치는 것보다는 설계에 집중하고, 실무는 ai가 하는 시대가 온 것 같다. 아무튼 이전과 달리 딕셔너리에 데이터 배열을 넣고 한번에 출력 되게 하니 성능도 좋아진 것 같다.(물론 컴퓨터들이 성능이 좋아져서 사람이 체감하긴 어렵다.)]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/works/microsoft/excel-vba/(리팩토링)excel-vba_테이블-구조-변경-자동화.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Works/Microsoft/Excel VBA/(리팩토링)Excel VBA_테이블 구조 변경 자동화.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 09:36:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Appsheet를 활용한 Laser Welding 작업 일보 어플리케이션(MVP) 최단기간 구현]]></title><description><![CDATA[DV 단계인 배터리 모듈 팩의 레이저 용접 공정의 수기 작업 일보를 보니 날짜, 모듈번호, 불량수량만 적고 있었다. 그 수기 문서를 바탕으로 불량내역을 또 엑셀로 정리하고 있었는데 이는 유의미한 데이터로 생각할 수가 없었다. 임시 작업이라지만 DV 단계에서 불량의 원인과 현상 등을 좀 더 체계적으로 정리할 필요를 느꼈고, 종이 문서를 굳이 전산화하는 작업도 없애고자 MVP 기능의 작업일보 앱을 만들어 보고자 했다. MVP라곤 했지만 충분히 Small Business나 소규모 생산현장 등에서는 Appsheet를 메인 툴로 활용도 가능할 것 같아서 블로그를 남긴다. 내가 작업한 것은 하나의 예시로 본인들이 원하는 앱을 구현해 보시길 바란다.
생산 데이터 입력 기능
Unique Key (ModuleKey) 중복 방지
재작업 데이터 입력 기능
실시간 대시보드 구현 가능 여부
Rework 작업 시간 계산
작업 History 확인 기능
가장 빠른 기간 내(하루)에 앱을 구현할 수 있는 방법을 찾다 보니 Appsheet가 현재 목적에 딱 어울리는 것 같았다.(예상 개발 시간 4시간 내외) 또한 구글 Spreadsheet에 연동하여 실시간 대시보드를 구현하는 것도 어렵지 않았기 때문에 Appsheet에 구글 Spreadsheet를 연동하여 구현하는 것으로 가닥을 잡았다.테이블의 Entity를 정의한다.일단은 간단한 기능만 구현하기 때문에 이정도로 정해두고 필요한 사항은 추가적으로 등록하여 스키마를 업데이트하도록 한다.구글 Spreadsheet에 테이블을 만들고 해당 Entity 이름이 헤더로 구성된 테이블을 작성한다.<img alt="Pasted image 20241014163125.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241014163125.png" target="_self"><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241014163233.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241014163233.png" target="_self"><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241014163347.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241014163347.png" target="_self"><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241014163539.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241014163539.png" target="_self">NAME열에는 Spreadsheet의 열 이름이 입력된다. Appsheet는 열 이름을 기준으로 참조하기 때문에 해당 NAME을 수정하거나 Spreadsheet의 열 이름을 바꾸면 오류가 발생할 수 있다.
Label? 의 경우, 특히나 차트 기능을 구현할 경우 축의 기준으로 적용하기도 하니 참고.
Formula는 사용자로부터 데이터를 입력 받는 것이 아니라 수식으로 자동 계산되게 하고 싶은 경우에 사용한다.
Show? 는 엔드유저에게 해당 열이 보이게 할 지 선택하는 항목이다. 수식을 넣어 다양하게 활용할 수 있으며, 만약 FALSE로 세팅된 경우는 Initial Value도 적용되지 않으니 주의한다.
Editable? 엔드유저가 해당 정보를 수정하게 할 지 여부이다.
Require? 필수 정보로 등록하여 해당 값이 누락될 경우, 누락 메세지와 함께 데이터 저장이 불가능하게 된다.
NULL 값을 피하고 싶은 경우, Initial Value에 디폴트 값을 입력해주면 된다.
나머지는 필요에 따라 적절하게 적용한다.우선 ID는 자동으로 Key 속성이 설정되었으니 필요에 따라 나머지 속성 값들을 바꿔주면 된다.
우선 Formula로 값이 입력되게 하고 싶은 열을 정의한다.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241015070312.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241015070312.png" target="_self">IF(

[reworkEndTime] - [reworkStartTime]
따라서 Duration이 엔드유저에게 표시되는 시점은 [reworkEndTime]이 입력된 시점, 즉 값이 양수로 변한 상태인 게 바람직하다. Show if?에 추가적인 수식을 적는다. Duration으로 리턴된 값은 직접적으로 숫자와 비교가 불가능하기 때문에 초(TOTALSECONDS)로 변환해 주었다.TOTALSECONDS([reworkDuration]) &gt; 0

그런데 텍스트로만 표현된 불량 내역은 직관적이지 못하다.
그래서 대시보드에서 바로 불량 사진을 확인할 수 있도록 구현하고자 했다.
우선 구현하고자 하는 기능과 Power BI, Sharepoint List의 기능을 점검했다.
대시보드 구현 어플리케이션: Power BI
데이터베이스: Sharepoint List (Dataverse나 SQL 등과 다르게 추가 비용이 발생하지 않음. 다만 데이터베이스로 사용하기엔 한계가 명확.) Power BI 대시보드에서 불량 사진을 바로 확인할 수 있는 기능 구현
(Power BI에서는 URL이 저장된 열이 있다면 Data Category를 변경하여 사진으로 출력하는 기능 있는 것으로 확인) Sharepoint List에 Image를 등록하면 레코드 형태로 저장되기 때문에 Power BI에서 바로 출력이 불가능 Sharepoint List에 Image가 등록/수정되면 Power Automate로 JSON을 파싱하여 이미지 URL 추출하여 imgURL이라는 열에 저장 <img alt="Pasted image 20241008132222.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008132222.png" target="_self"><br> <img alt="Pasted image 20241008132325.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008132325.png" target="_self">
Site Address: 파싱 대상 Sharepoint List의 주소 선택
Method: GET
Uri:
//'listName'에 Sharepoint List의 Internal Name을 넣어준다.
//items다음의 $orderby=Created desc&amp;$top=1 는 리스트의 항목 생성시간을 내림차순으로 정렬하고, 가장 상위의 값 1개를 가져오는 명령이다. /_api/web/lists/getbytitle('listName')/items?$orderby=Created desc&amp;$top=1
<br> <img alt="Pasted image 20241008134855.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008134855.png" target="_self"><br>

값을 살펴보면 “_metadata”: 내에 “uri”가 저장되어 있다.
그리고 “image”에 리스트 형태로 “fileName”이 저장되어 있다.
그 아래로 스크롤을 내리다 보면 fileName을 확인할 수 있다.
이제 Parse JSON Flow를 추가하여 위 body 데이터에서 필요한 값만 추출해서 imgURL이라는 변수를 생성하고 값을 할당하면 된다.
그런데 작업 도중에 Sharepoint 커넥터의 Get attachments를 사용하면 더 간단하게 원하는 결과물을 도출할 수 있다는 걸 알게 됐다.
(위의 Send HTTP request 액션은 너무나 자주 사용하는 액션이므로 그대로 두겠다.) <br>Sharepoint 커넥터의 Get attachments 액션을 사용하면 Sharepoint List에 등록된 항목의 첨부파일 정보 중 “Id”, “AbsoluteUri”, “Display Name”을 가져올 수 있다. 따라서 Parse JSON 액션 등의 과정을 생략할 수 있다. <img alt="Pasted image 20241008141135.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008141135.png" target="_self">
※ For each는 배열이나 여러 항목 등을 반환하는 액션이 있거나 액션에서 필요로 할 경우, 자동 생성됨<br><img alt="Pasted image 20241008141545.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008141545.png" target="_self">
When an item is created or modified: 트리거로 설정한다. 이미지가 등록될 때뿐만 아니라 이미지 수정이 이루어질 경우에도 대응되도록 한다.
Get attachments: 등록/수정된 이미지의 AbsoluteUri를 읽는다.
Condition: imgURL 열에 이미 등록된 값이 있다면 읽어온 AbsoluteUri와 비교하여 서로가 다를 경우에만 항목이 업데이트 되도록 한다.<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20241008141832.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20241008141832.png" target="_self">

이미지가 정상적으로 출력된다. 이제 차트에 마우스 커서를 올리면 툴팁으로 사진을 확인할 수 있게 구현해본다. 우선 새로운 Power BI 보고서에 새로운 페이지를 추가한다.
Page의 Format에서 Page type을 Tooltip으로 설정한다. 그리고 캔버스의 크기를 필요한 만큼 조절한다.<br>

Python에서 리스트의 각 요소가 튜플인 경우, for 루프를 사용하여 튜플의 요소들을 자동으로 변수에 할당할 수 있습니다. 이를 언패킹(unpacking)이라고 합니다.
리스트 a는 세 개의 튜플 (1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)을 포함합니다.
for 루프가 리스트 a를 순회하면서 각 튜플을 순서대로 처리합니다.
for (first, last) in a: 문장은 각 튜플의 첫 번째 요소를 first 변수에, 두 번째 요소를 last 변수에 할당합니다. 이를 언패킹이라고 합니다.
이 과정을 단계별로 살펴보면: 첫 번째 루프에서 (1, 2)가 first와 last 변수에 각각 할당됩니다.
first, last = (1, 2)
print(first + last) # 1 + 2 = 3 두 번째 루프에서 (3, 4)가 first와 last 변수에 각각 할당됩니다.
first, last = (3, 4)
print(first + last) # 3 + 4 = 7 세 번째 루프에서 (5, 6)가 first와 last 변수에 각각 할당됩니다.
first, last = (5, 6)
print(first + last) # 5 + 6 = 11 이렇게 루프가 진행되면서 각 튜플의 요소들이 first와 last 변수에 자동으로 할당되어, first + last의 결과가 출력됩니다.이 개념을 언패킹이라고 하며, Python에서 매우 유용하게 사용되는 기능입니다. 여러 값을 포함하는 데이터 구조를 손쉽게 분해하여 개별 변수에 할당할 수 있게 해줍니다.MOC:: <a data-href="📚 630 Programming" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📚 630 Programming</a><br>Depart. :: <a data-href="👤 2.

가능했던 방법은,
미니탭 사용
Python matplotlibrary 사용
두가지인데,
이중 미니탭의 장점은 간단하고 빠르다는 것, 단점은 구독 비용.(라이센스 1개 3년 구독 비용이 370만원에 육박한다.)
회사에서 보유하고 있는 공유 라이센스가 있지만, FAT를 하면 갑자기 여러 부서에서 미니탭 수요가 급증하므로 필요할 때 쓰기가 어렵다. 또 모든 회사가 미니탭을 구독해서 사용하지는 않으므로 직접 구현해보는 것도 괜찮다고 판단.
그리고 이전부터 존재한다고 알고는 있었지만 한번도 사용해 보지는 않은, Power BI 내의 Python Script 기능을 학습하는 겸 직접 구현해 보기로 했다. (필수) Python 설치(나는 이미 설치되어 있으므로 생략)
(선택) Visual Studio Code 설치(Power BI에 Python Script를 외부 IDE로 작성하는 기능이 있어서 있으면 좋다. 단, 양자간 동기화는 되지 않는다. Copy and Paste 필요.)
Power BI 설정에서 Python home directory 선택(파이썬이 이미 설치된 상태라면 자동으로 선택되어 있을 수도 있음)
<img alt="Pasted image 20240920142431.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20240920142431.png" target="_self">

이러면 준비가 완료된 것이다.
이후에는 Python script editor에 코드를 작성해주면 된다. 라이브러리는 Power BI 옵션에 설정했던 파이썬 버전을 따라가므로 필요한 라이브러리가 있다면 미리 설치해두면 좋다.
(내가 사용한 라이브러리는 pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy 이다.)
Python script editor의 외부 IDE 기능을 써서 script를 열어보면,<br>

위와 같은 화면을 볼 수 있다. 기본으로 os, uuid, matplotlib, pands를 import 하는 것을 볼 수 있다. 그리고 아래의 dataset을 보면 데이터를 임시로 csv로 저장하고 pandas로 프레임을 만들어 준다는 걸 알 수 있다.
그리고 데이터셋에서 중복값을 삭제하도록 기본 설정되어 있으므로, 만약 데이터가 의미 있는 중복값을 갖고 있다면 고유 id를 생성하여 지워지지 않도록 막아주면 된다.(나는 Power BI Query Editor에서 Index열을 추가해줬다.)이제 코드를 작성하면 된다. 한가지 주의할 점은 위의 코드의 주석으로 안내된 내용처럼 외부IDE에서 코드를 작성하고 저장한다고 해도 Power BI의 Python script editor에 적용되는 것은 아니다. 작성한 코드를 복사해서 Python script editor에 붙여넣기 하는 작업이 필요하다.import numpy as np

plt.show() 객체 안에 2열로 Plot의 갯수(위 variables 리스트의 딕셔너리 갯수)만큼 그래프가 표시되도록 했다.
표본 데이터의 갯수에 따라 bins의 값을 수정해 준다.ax.hist(data, bins=50, density=True, alpha=0.7, color='skyblue')
그리고 출력된 그래프를 보고 x_margin = (usl - lsl) * 0.2 ax.set_xlim(lsl - x_margin, usl + x_margin)
의 margin 값을 수정해 준다. (값이 USL, LSL과 동떨어질 경우는 그래프가 이상하게 표시될 수 있으니 아예 수식을 수정하는 것이 낫다.)아래와 같이 출력된 결과물을 확인한다. 결과물을 보고 수정이 필요한 부분이나 추가할 내용이 있으면 코드를 수정해준다.<br>

End Sub W/O라는 열은, 계획에 Primary Key가 없기 때문에(P/O 하나에 온갖 제품이 다 엮여 있다.) 관계형 데이터베이스에서 데이터가 꼬인다. 그래서 궁여지책으로 3열 결합 키를 임의로 부여했다.(나중에 안 거지만 이렇게 3중 결합 키를 사용했는데도 중복된 키가 나왔다… 데이터 정규화의 중요성)
이 버전을 처음에 작성할 때는 Power BI와 연결한 원본을 Excel파일로 관리했기 때문에 별도의 ID를 부여할 필요가 있었다.(아니면 Power BI의 Query Editor에서 인덱싱 열을 추가해도 됐지만 당시에는 몰랐다.)
achProcess는 생산 실적을 집계하는 공정(예를 들어 포장)이 무엇인지 achProcess 시트의 테이블에서 제품 타입을 기반으로 실적 집계 공정을 검색해서 구조 변경된 데이터에 추가하도록 했다.이제 아래와 같이 데이터를 붙여 넣고 이제 매크로를 실행하면,<br>

하지만 문서의 양이 방대하고 각 절차의 복잡성과 결재 라인 등이 복잡하며, 선/후 관계가 한 눈에 파악되지 않기 때문에 이런 문제를 극복하기 위하여 Visio를 사용했다.처음에 다이어그램을 그리기 시작했을 때 생각했던 사이즈보다 훨씬 커졌지만, 다행히 Visio의 유연한 캔버스 사이즈 덕분에 작업을 원활히 이어갈 수 있었다. 다른 다이어그램 도구들과 달리 Visio는 복잡한 워크플로우와 대규모 다이어그램을 처리하는 데 매우 유리했다.그리는 작업이 결코 쉽지는 않았지만 완성하고 보니, 문서로 읽기만 했을 때는 한 눈에 들어오지 않던 문제들이 속속들이 보이기 시작했다. 필수적인 결재 절차가 누락된 경우도 여러 건이었으며, 이러한 문제는 기존에 문서만으로는 쉽게 파악할 수 없었다.그렇게 절차를 검토하면서 그 외 중요하게 다뤄야 할 관련 문서 중, 문제가 있는 것들은 해당 문제가 있는 부분만 따로 발췌하여 다이어그램 옆에 삽입하고, 정확히 어떤 프로세스와 연관되어 있는지 표시해 두었다. 이러한 시각적 작업은 팀원들과의 협업에서도 유용하게 활용되었으며, 중요한 피드백을 쉽게 수집할 수 있었다.<img alt="Pasted image 20240905095444.png" src="https://64etuor.github.io/assets/image/pasted-image-20240905095444.png" target="_self"><br>MOC:: <a data-href="📚 652 Process Documentation" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📚 652 Process Documentation</a> | <a data-href="📚 634 Software Development" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📚 634 Software Development</a> | <a data-href="📚 618 AI Frameworks" href="https://64etuor.github.io/.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">📚 618 AI Frameworks</a><br>Depart. :: <a data-href="👤 3.

그런데 mysql을 통한 실무단에서는 잘 사용하지 않는듯 하여
실무에 사용하는 방법을 간단하게 적어봅니다.
사실은 이미 Tip&amp;Tech에서도 나와 있지만 Remind 차원에서 적어봅니다. 쿼리에서 속도가 많이 걸리는 부분이 일반적으로 like 문과 or 같은 것입니다.
그중 가장 안좋은 것이 like와 or를 같이 써야 하는 것이겠지요. QA 질문을 답하다 보면 필드 값으로 1|2|3|4|5|... 와 같은 구조가 있는데
해당 값중 2와 5값이 들어 있는 row를 찾고 싶다라는 질문을 종종 받습니다. 이런 값을 찾을 때는 대체적으로 아래와 같은 쿼리로 실행을 하지요.
where 필드 like '%2|%' or&nbsp; 필드 like '%5|%'
그런데 이를 비트연산으로 바꾸면 속도가 상당히 개선됩니다. 우선 비교 연산의 속도부터 알아보자면 빠른순서대로 비트연산 &gt; 숫자 &gt; 문자 의 순입니다. 선택항목이 다음과 같이 A~P까지 있고 다중선택 가능한 항목있다고 하겠습니다.
아래에서 0000 0000 0000 0000 이런 부분은 16자리(16bit)의 2진수 입니다.
그리고 1, 2, 4, 8 ... 은 그 2진수를 10진수로 변환한 값이구요.
이 값은 2의0승부터 시작하여 2의 제곱수로 되어 있는걸 아실수 있을겁니다.
그리고 A, B, C, D ... 은 각 10진수에 해당되는 화면에 표시되는 우리가 선택할 항목이구요.
비트 연산은 NOT OR XOR AND 가 있는데 그중 자주 사용하는것은 AND 연산입니다. 0000 0000 0000 0001 1 A
0000 0000 0000 0010 2 B
0000 0000 0000 0100 4 C
0000 0000 0000 1000 8 D
0000 0000 0001 0000 16 E
0000 0000 0010 0000 32 F
0000 0000 0100 0000 64 G
0000 0000 1000 0000 128 H
0000 0001 0000 0000 256 I
0000 0010 0000 0000 512 J
0000 0100 0000 0000 1024 K
0000 1000 0000 0000 2048 L
0001 0000 0000 0000 4096 M
0010 0000 0000 0000 8192 N
0100 0000 0000 0000 16384 O
1000 0000 0000 0000 32768 P 우리가 A 와 B 를 선택한다고 하면 더하기를 해서
0000 0000 0000 0001 1 A
0000 0000 0000 0010 2 B 0000 0000 0000 0011 3 A+B
이런 결과 값이 되는 것입니다.
이때 DB에 저장할때는 3이란 숫자를 저장하게 됩니다. 위의 모든 값을 저장한다고 하면 모든값을 더한다는 말과 같기에
1111 1111 1111 1111 65535 (A+B+C+D+E+F+G+H+I+J+K+L+M+N+O+P) 가 됩니다.
이와 같은 구조는 2진수의 자리수가 늘어날때마다 선택사항을 추가, 확인할수 있는 구조가 됩니다.
A+B = 3, D+F+K = 1064 ....
이런식으로 16개의 선택항목중 어떤것이 선택되었고 선택되지 않았는지를
10진수의 숫자로 구분이 가능하다는 것이죠. 그럼 실제 예제로 사용해보겠습니다. 다중선택 페이지 1.php &lt;?php $aMultiSelect = Array ( "1"=&gt;"A","2"=&gt;"B","4"=&gt;"C","8"=&gt;"D", "16"=&gt;"E","32"=&gt;"F","64"=&gt;"G","128"=&gt;"H", "256"=&gt;"I","512"=&gt;"J","1024"=&gt;"K","2048"=&gt;"L", "4096"=&gt;"M","8192"=&gt;"N","16384"=&gt;"O","32768"=&gt;"P" ); echo " &lt;form method=post action='2.php'&gt;"; foreach ($aMultiSelect as $sKey =&gt; $sVal) { echo " &lt;input type='checkbox' name='multiselect[]' value='$sKey'&gt;$sVal&lt;br /&gt;"; } echo " &lt;input type='submit' value='submit'&gt; &lt;/form&gt;"; ?&gt; 저는 여기서 A D E를 선택했습니다. 선택되어진 값을 + 하여 DB에 저장하는 페이지 2.php &lt;?php $sSum = 0; foreach ($_POST[multiselect] as $sKey=&gt;$sVal) { &nbsp; $sSum += $sVal; } //$sSum 을 DB에 저장, A D E를 선택했으니 25겠죠 ?&gt; DB에서 값을 찾을때...
A(1), B(2), C(4)중 하나라도 포함된것을 찾으려고 합니다.
1+2+4 = 7 이므로
select * from 테이블 where 필드&amp;7&gt;0;
AND(&amp;) 연산은 각 자릿수를 비교해, 두값에 모두 1이 있을 때에만 1을 반환합니다.
0000 0000 0001 1001 25 &lt;== DB에 저장되어 있는 형태
0000 0000 0000 0111 7 &lt;== 비교값 0000 0000 0000 0001 1 결과값 1은 0 보다 크거나 같기에 좀전에 저장했던 데이터가 출력될것입니다.
그러면 D, E 두개다 저장된것을 찾고 싶을 때도 잇을겁니다.
이때는 8+16 = 24 이므로
select * from 테이블 where bit_count(필드&amp;24)=2;
0000 0000 0001 1001 25 &lt;== DB에 저장되어 있는 형태
0000 0000 0001 1000 24 &lt;== 비교값 0000 0000 0001 1000 24
여기서 bit_count는 2진수의 1의 갯수를 세었다고 생각하시면 됩니다.
D, E를 And 연산하여 참인것이 2개인것을 찾아라라는 말입니다. 그럼 And 와 or 가 같이 들어가 있는걸 검색해보겠습니다.
쿼리고 where 필드 like '%A%' or (필드 like '%D%' and 필드 like '%E%')
보기만 해도 시간이 많이 걸릴 쿼리 같으시죠...
이걸 비트연산으로 바꾸면
select * from 테이블 where 필드&amp;1&gt;0 or bit_count(필드&amp;24)=2;
이와 같이 바뀌게 됩니다. 이와같은 비트연산은 속도 뿐만 아니라 쿼리도 간단히 할수 있고 구조적으로도 관리하기가 편합니다.
그래서 비트연산을 사용하는것이죠 간만에 적으니 두서없이 생각나는대로 막 적은것 같습니다.
그래도 도움이 되었으면 좋겠네요. ^^]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/works/programming/dbms/dbms_mysql에서의-비트연산-활용-예시.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Works/Programming/DBMS/DBMS_MySQL에서의 비트연산 활용 예시.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 01:23:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Flutter 개발 환경 설정]]></title><description><![CDATA[아래는 Flutter 개발 환경 설정을 위한 완성된 문서입니다. 이 문서는 Flutter SDK 설치부터 Android SDK 설정, flutter doctor를 통한 환경 설정 확인까지 포함하고 있습니다.Flutter는 하나의 코드베이스로 iOS와 Android 앱을 개발할 수 있는 강력한 프레임워크입니다. 이 문서에서는 Flutter 개발 환경을 설정하는 방법을 단계별로 자세히 설명하겠습니다.
Flutter SDK 설치
IDE 설치 및 설정
Android SDK 설정
flutter doctor로 환경 설정 확인
모바일 에뮬레이터 설정
Flutter 프로젝트 생성 및 실행 Flutter 공식 웹사이트(<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://flutter.dev/)%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://flutter.dev/)%EC%97%90%EC%84%9C" target="_self">https://flutter.dev/)에서</a> 운영체제에 맞는 Flutter SDK를 다운로드합니다. Windows: .zip 파일
macOS: .dmg 파일
Linux: .tar.xz 파일 다운로드한 파일의 압축을 원하는 디렉터리로 해제합니다. 예시: C:\src\flutter (Windows), ~/flutter (macOS/Linux) Flutter SDK를 시스템 PATH에 추가하여 터미널에서 Flutter 명령어를 쉽게 실행할 수 있도록 합니다.
시스템 속성 -&gt; 고급 시스템 설정 -&gt; 환경 변수를 엽니다.
사용자 변수 또는 시스템 변수의 Path를 선택하고 편집을 클릭합니다.
Flutter SDK의 bin 폴더 경로를 추가합니다. 예시: C:\src\flutter\bin 터미널에 다음 명령어를 입력하여 .bashrc, .bash_profile, 또는 .zshrc 파일에 Flutter 경로를 추가합니다.export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
변경 사항을 적용하기 위해 터미널을 재시작하거나 source ~/.bashrc를 실행합니다.Flutter가 올바르게 설치되었는지 확인하기 위해 flutter doctor 명령어를 사용합니다.flutter doctor
이 명령어는 Flutter 설치 상태를 진단하고 필요한 추가 설치 항목을 안내합니다.Flutter 개발을 위해 주로 사용하는 IDE는 다음과 같습니다:
Visual Studio Code: 가볍고 빠르며, Flutter 플러그인을 통해 강력한 지원을 제공합니다.
Android Studio: 전체적인 Android 개발 도구와 통합되어 있으며, 강력한 디버깅 기능과 에뮬레이터 지원을 제공합니다. <br>Visual Studio Code 다운로드 및 설치: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_self">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a> 에서 다운로드합니다.
Flutter 플러그인 설치: VS Code를 실행한 후, 왼쪽 사이드바에서 Extensions 아이콘을 클릭합니다.
"Flutter"와 "Dart" 플러그인을 검색하여 설치합니다. Flutter 프로젝트 생성: View -&gt; Command Palette -&gt; Flutter: New Project를 선택하여 새로운 Flutter 프로젝트를 생성합니다. <br>Android Studio 다운로드 및 설치: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_self">https://developer.android.com/studio</a> 에서 다운로드합니다.
Flutter 플러그인 설치: Android Studio를 실행하고, Plugins 메뉴로 이동하여 "Flutter" 플러그인을 설치합니다. 이는 Dart 플러그인을 자동으로 설치해줍니다. Android SDK 설치: Android Studio에서 SDK Manager를 열어 Android SDK, SDK Platform, 그리고 Android Virtual Device (AVD)를 설치합니다. Flutter 프로젝트 생성: File -&gt; New -&gt; New Flutter Project를 선택하여 새로운 Flutter 프로젝트를 생성합니다. Flutter는 Android SDK Command-line tools가 필요합니다. 이를 설치하기 위해 다음 단계를 따릅니다. Android Studio 실행: Android Studio를 실행합니다. SDK Manager 열기: File -&gt; Settings (macOS에서는 Preferences)로 이동한 후, Appearance &amp; Behavior -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Android SDK를 선택합니다. SDK Tools 탭 선택: SDK Tools 탭으로 이동합니다. Android SDK Command-line tools 체크: 목록에서 Android SDK Command-line tools (latest)를 선택합니다.
체크박스에 체크가 되어 있지 않다면, 체크하고 Apply 버튼을 눌러 설치를 진행합니다. 설치 확인: 설치가 완료되면 OK 버튼을 눌러 설정을 저장합니다. Flutter 개발 환경이 올바르게 설정되었는지 확인하려면, 터미널에서 다음 명령어를 실행합니다.flutter doctor
flutter doctor는 다음과 같은 사항들을 점검합니다:
Flutter SDK 설치 여부
Android SDK 설치 여부
Xcode 설치 여부 (macOS에서만)
Android Studio 및 Flutter/Dart 플러그인 설치 여부
연결된 디바이스(에뮬레이터 또는 실제 디바이스) 여부
각 항목의 상태가 출력되며, X 마크가 있는 경우 해당 항목에 문제가 있음을 나타냅니다. 문제가 발생한 경우 Flutter는 그에 따른 해결 방법을 제안합니다.만약 flutter doctor 출력에서 Android SDK Command-line tools와 관련된 문제가 발생한 경우, 위에서 설명한 대로 SDK Tools 탭에서 Android SDK Command-line tools (latest)를 설치했는지 확인하고, 설치 후 flutter doctor를 다시 실행합니다.
AVD Manager 실행: Android Studio에서 AVD Manager를 엽니다 (Tools -&gt; Device Manager). 새로운 가상 장치 생성: Create Virtual Device 버튼을 클릭하고, 원하는 기기 유형과 Android 버전을 선택하여 새로운 가상 장치를 만듭니다. 에뮬레이터 실행: 생성한 가상 장치를 선택하고 Play 버튼을 눌러 에뮬레이터를 실행합니다. Xcode 설치: Mac App Store에서 Xcode를 다운로드하고 설치합니다. Xcode 설정: Xcode를 실행하고 Preferences -&gt; Locations 탭에서 Command Line Tools를 설정합니다. iOS 시뮬레이터 실행: Xcode의 Window -&gt; Devices and Simulators에서 iOS 시뮬레이터를 실행할 수 있습니다. Flutter 프로젝트를 생성하여 환경 설정이 제대로 동작하는지 테스트합니다.flutter create my_flutter_app
생성한 Flutter 프로젝트 디렉터리로 이동한 후, 앱을 실행합니다.cd my_flutter_app
flutter run
flutter doctor를 통해 모든 환경이 제대로 설정되었음을 확인한 후, 앱이 정상적으로 실행되면 Flutter 개발 환경이 성공적으로 설정된 것입니다.
Hot Reload: 코드 변경 사항을 빠르게 적용하기 위해 터미널에서 r 키를 누릅니다.
Hot Restart: 전체 앱을 재시작하기 위해 R 키를 누릅니다.

All modern browsers have a threaded scrolling feature to permit scrolling to run smoothly even when expensive
JavaScript is running, but this optimization is partially defeated by the need to wait for the results of<br>
any touchstart and touchmove handlers, which may prevent the scroll entirely by calling <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/#the-touchstart-event" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/#the-touchstart-event" target="_self"><code></code></a>preventDefault() on the event. While there are particular scenarios where an author may indeed want to prevent scrolling, analysis indicates that the majority of touch event handlers on the web never actually
call preventDefault(), so browsers often block scrolling unnecessarily. For instance, in Chrome for Android 80% of the touch events that block scrolling never actually prevent it. 10% of these events add more than 100ms of delay to the start of scrolling, and a catastrophic delay of at least 500ms occurs in 1% of scrolls.<br>Many developers are surprised to learn that <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://rbyers.github.io/janky-touch-scroll.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="http://rbyers.github.io/janky-touch-scroll.html" target="_self">simply adding an empty touch handler to their document</a> can have a<br>
significant negative impact on scroll performance. Developers quite reasonably expect that the act of observing an event <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#observing-event-listeners" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#observing-event-listeners" target="_self">should not have any side-effects</a>.<br>The fundamental problem here is not limited to touch events. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#events-wheelevents" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#events-wheelevents" target="_self"><code></code> events</a>wheel<br>
suffer from an identical issue. In contrast, <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/" target="_self">pointer event handlers</a> are
designed to never delay scrolling (though developers can declaratively suppress scrolling altogether with the touch-action CSS property), so do not suffer from this issue. Essentially the passive event listener proposal brings the performance properties of pointer events to touch and wheel events.<br>This proposal provides a way for authors to indicate at handler registration time whether the handler may call preventDefault() on the event (i.e. whether it needs an event that is <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-cancelable" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-cancelable" target="_self">cancelable</a>). When no touch or wheel handlers at a particular point require a cancelable event, a user agent is free to start scrolling immediately without waiting for JavaScript. That is, passive listeners are free from surprising performance side-effects.First, we need a mechanism for attaching additional information to an event listener. Today the capture argument to addEventListener is the closest example of something like this, but its usage is pretty opaque: document.addEventListener('touchstart', handler, true);
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dictdef-eventlisteneroptions" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dictdef-eventlisteneroptions" target="_self"><code></code></a>EventListenerOptions lets us write this more explicitly as: document.addEventListener('touchstart', handler, {capture: true});
<br>This is simply the new (extensible) syntax for existing behavior - specifying <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing#capturing" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing#capturing" target="_self">whether you want the listener invoked during the capture phase or bubbling phase</a>.Now that we have an extensible syntax for specifying options at event handler registration time, we can add a new passive option which declares up-front that the listener will never call preventDefault() on the event. If it does, the user agent will just ignore the request (ideally generating at least a console warning), as it already does for events with Event.cancelable=false. A developer can verify this by querying Event.defaultPrevented before and after calling preventDefault(). Eg: addEventListener(document, "touchstart", function(e) { console.log(e.defaultPrevented); // will be false e.preventDefault(); // does nothing since the listener is passive console.log(e.defaultPrevented); // still false }, Modernizr.passiveeventlisteners ? {passive: true} : false);
<br>Now rather than having to block scrolling whenever there are any touch or wheel listener, the browser only needs to do this when there are non-passive listeners (see <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#cancelability" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="http://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#cancelability" target="_self">TouchEvents spec</a>). passive listeners are free of performance side-effects.By marking a touch or wheel listener as passive, the developer is promising the handler won't call preventDefault to disable scrolling. This frees the browser up to respond to scrolling immediately without waiting for JavaScript, thus ensuring a reliably smooth scrolling experience for the user.<br>Because older browsers will interpret any object in the 3rd argument as a true value for the capture argument, it's important for developers to use feature detection or <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4" target="_self">a polyfill</a> when using this API, to avoid unforeseen results. Feature detection for specific options can be done as follows:// Test via a getter in the options object to see if the passive property is accessed
var supportsPassive = false;
try { var opts = Object.defineProperty({}, 'passive', { get: function() { supportsPassive = true; } }); window.addEventListener("testPassive", null, opts); window.removeEventListener("testPassive", null, opts);
} catch (e) {} // Use our detect's results. passive applied if supported, capture will be false either way.
elem.addEventListener('touchstart', fn, supportsPassive ? { passive: true } : false); <br>To make this simpler you can use the feature detect from <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/rafrex/detect-it" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/rafrex/detect-it" target="_self">Detect It</a>, eg: elem.addEventListener('touchstart', fn, detectIt.passiveEvents ? {passive:true} : false);
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://modernizr.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://modernizr.com/" target="_self">Modernizr</a> also has a detect <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1982" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1982" target="_self">here</a>. There is an <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/107" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/107" target="_self">open standards debate</a> around providing a simpler API for dictionary member feature detection.There are scenarios where an author may intentionally want to consistently disable scrolling by cancelling all touch or wheel events. These include:
Panning and zooming a map
Full-page/full-screen games
In these cases, the current behavior (which prevents scrolling optimization) is perfectly adequate, since scrolling itself is being prevented consistently. There is no need to use passive listeners in these cases, though it's often still a good idea to apply a touch-action: none CSS rule to make your intention explicit (eg. supporting browsers with Pointer Events but not Touch Events). However, in a number of common scenarios events don't need to block scrolling - for instance:
User activity monitoring which just wants to know when the user was last active
touchstart handlers that hide some active UI (like tooltips)
touchstart and touchend handlers that style UI elements (without suppressing the click event).
For these scenarios, the passive option can be added (with appropriate feature detection) without any other code changes, resulting in a significantly smoother scrolling experience.There are a few more complicated scenarios where the handler only wants to suppress scrolling under certain conditions, such as:
Swiping horizontally to rotate a carousel, dismiss an item or reveal a drawer, while still permitting vertical scrolling. <br>In this case, use <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action" target="_self">touch-action: pan-y</a> to declaratively disable scrolling that starts along the horizontal axis without having to call preventDefault() (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://rbyers.github.io/touch-action.html" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://rbyers.github.io/touch-action.html" target="_self">test page</a>).
To continue to work correctly in all browsers, calls to preventDefault should be conditional on the lack of support for the particular touch-action rule being used (note that Safari 9 currently only supports touch-action: manipulation). A UI element (like YouTube's volume slider) which slides on horizontal wheel events without changing the scrolling behavior on vertical wheel events. Since there is no equivalent of "touch-action" for wheel events, this case can only be implemented with non-passive wheel listeners.
Event delegation patterns where the code that adds the listener won't know if the consumer will cancel the event. One option here is to do delegation separately for passive and non-passive listeners (as if they were different event types entirely).
<br>It's also possible to leverage touch-action as above (treating Touch Events as you would <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link is-unresolved" href="https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/" target="_self">Pointer Events</a>. <br>You can get a quick idea of the benefit possible (and potential breakage) by forcing touch/wheel listeners to be treated as passive via chrome://flags/#passive-listener-default (new in Chrome 52).

If your site has logic that runs for &gt;100ms at a time, it will still feel sluggish in response to taps / clicks. Passive event listeners just allow developers to decouple the issue of having JS responsiveness reflected in scroll performance from the desire to monitor input events.

Set against the backdrop of the 1968 Prague Spring and its subsequent Soviet-led invasion, the story primarily follows the lives of Tomas, a surgeon and a philanderer, and Tereza, his wife and a photographer, along with other central characters like Sabina, Tomas's mistress, and Franz, her lover.Kundera masterfully explores the dichotomy of lightness and weight, a central theme of the novel. This philosophical concept questions whether life is a fleeting, insignificant occurrence (lightness) or a series of meaningful events and responsibilities (weight). Through his characters, Kundera examines how each approach impacts one's existence and relationships.The novel is also remarkable for its exploration of political and historical contexts, particularly the impact of Czechoslovakia's political turmoil on its citizens. It provides a poignant commentary on how external political forces can intrude into and shape personal lives, relationships, and moral decisions.Moreover, Kundera's narrative style, characterized by its introspective and often non-linear approach, invites readers to engage deeply with the characters' psychological landscapes. This introspection is balanced with moments of irony and humor, making the novel as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.In terms of its impact on literature and culture, "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" stands out for its philosophical depth, its innovative narrative structure, and its profound exploration of human emotions and the existential plight. It remains a vital read for anyone interested in the intersections of love, personal freedom, and the inescapable influence of historical and political contexts on human life.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/milan-kundera/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being/]]></description><link>https://64etuor.github.io/books/assets/canvas/kirkus-reviews-the-unbearable-lightness-of-being.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/Assets/Canvas/Kirkus Reviews - the Unbearable lightness of being.canvas</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Yangha Park]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 09:04:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[프란츠의 부인]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/pasted-image-20240119185645.png" draggable="false" target="_self">Pasted image 20240119185645.png<img src="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/pasted-image-20240119185902.png" draggable="false" target="_self">Pasted image 20240119185902.png]]></description><link>books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/프란츠의-부인.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/Studies/참을 수 없는 존재의 가벼움/Assets/프란츠의 부인.canvas</guid><pubDate>Sun, 01 Dec 2024 14:08:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/pasted-image-20240119185645.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/pasted-image-20240119185645.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[파르메니데스]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/pasted-image-20240119182924.png" draggable="false" target="_self">Pasted image 20240119182924.png테레자와 토마시는 무거움의 분위기 속에서 죽었다. 그녀는 가벼움의 분위기에서 죽고 싶었다. 그 가벼움은 공기보다도 가벼울 것이다. 파르메니데스에 따른다면 부정적인 것이 긍정적인 것으로 변모하는 것이다.죽음 = 비존재 = 없는 것 = 부정적인 것 '그 가벼움은 공기보다도 가벼울 것이다.'

로베스피에르(Maximilien Robespierre)는 프랑스 혁명의 중요한 인물로, 1758년에 태어나 1794년에 처형되었습니다. 그는 프랑스 혁명 초기에 입법 의회와 국민 협회의 중요한 멤버로 활동했으며, 혁명적 정부의 핵심 인물 중 한 명으로 부상했습니다.로베스피에르는 프랑스 혁명의 가장 극단적이고 폭력적인 단계인 '테러의 시대(Terror)'를 주도했습니다. 그는 혁명을 보호하고 적들을 제거하기 위해 폭력과 대규모 처형을 사용했습니다. 그의 이러한 행동은 그를 '테러의 상징'으로 만들었으며, 많은 무고한 사람들이 길로틴으로 처형되었습니다.로베스피에르는 자코뱅 클럽의 지도자로, 공화주의와 평등의 이상을 강하게 옹호했습니다. 그는 또한 왕정을 폐지하고 프랑스 제1공화국을 설립하는 데 중요한 역할을 했습니다. 그는 국가의 강력한 중앙 집권화를 추진했으며, 개인의 자유보다는 공공의 이익을 우선시하는 정치 철학을 가지고 있었습니다.하지만, 로베스피에르는 그의 독재적이고 폭력적인 방법들로 인해 결국 많은 적을 만들었습니다. 1794년, 그는 반대파에 의해 권력에서 축출되었고, 길로틴으로 처형되었습니다. 그의 사망은 '테러의 시대'의 종말을 의미하며, 프랑스 혁명의 변화를 가져왔습니다.로베스피에르의 역사적 평가는 복잡합니다. 어떤 이들은 그를 혁명적 이상을 위해 싸운 영웅으로 보는 반면, 다른 이들은 그의 폭력과 독재를 비판하며 두려움의 상징으로 여깁니다. 그의 인물과 행동은 프랑스 혁명과 그 이후의 역사에 깊은 영향을 미쳤으며, 현대에도 여전히 많은 토론과 연구의 대상이 되고 있습니다.]]></description><link>books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/로베스피에르.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/Studies/참을 수 없는 존재의 가벼움/Assets/로베스피에르.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 12:38:11

being]]></title><description><![CDATA["Unbearable Lightness of Being" by Milan Kundera is a profoundly insightful novel that delves into the intricate nuances of love, politics, and existential dilemmas. Set against the backdrop of the 1968 Prague Spring and its subsequent Soviet-led invasion, the story primarily follows the lives of Tomas, a surgeon and a philanderer, and Tereza, his wife and a photographer, along with other central characters like Sabina, Tomas's mistress, and Franz, her lover.Kundera masterfully explores the dichotomy of lightness and weight, a central theme of the novel. This philosophical concept questions whether life is a fleeting, insignificant occurrence (lightness) or a series of meaningful events and responsibilities (weight). Through his characters, Kundera examines how each approach impacts one's existence and relationships.The novel is also remarkable for its exploration of political and historical contexts, particularly the impact of Czechoslovakia's political turmoil on its citizens. It provides a poignant commentary on how external political forces can intrude into and shape personal lives, relationships, and moral decisions.Moreover, Kundera's narrative style, characterized by its introspective and often non-linear approach, invites readers to engage deeply with the characters' psychological landscapes. This introspection is balanced with moments of irony and humor, making the novel as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.In terms of its impact on literature and culture, "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" stands out for its philosophical depth, its innovative narrative structure, and its profound exploration of human emotions and the existential plight. It remains a vital read for anyone interested in the intersections of love, personal freedom, and the inescapable influence of historical and political contexts on human life.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/milan-kundera/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being/]]></description><link>books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/kirkus-reviews-the-unbearable-lightness-of-being.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/Studies/참을 수 없는 존재의 가벼움/Assets/Kirkus Reviews - the Unbearable lightness of being.canvas</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 09:04:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20240118201129]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/pasted-image-20240118201129.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/pasted-image-20240118201129.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/Studies/참을 수 없는 존재의 가벼움/Assets/Pasted image 20240118201129.png</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 11:11:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/pasted-image-20240118201129.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/assets/pasted-image-20240118201129.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[0_읽은 책 리스트]]></title><link>books/0_읽은-책-리스트.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/0_읽은 책 리스트.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2024 11:05:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://image.yes24.com/momo/TopCate388/MidCate007/4349940.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="https://image.yes24.com/momo/TopCate388/MidCate007/4349940.jpg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Do it! 점프 투 파이썬：중학생도 첫날부터 실습하는 초고속 입문서]]></title><description><![CDATA[

브라만의 아들 싯다르타는 존경받는 브라만 가문의 아들로 태어났으나, 전통적인 종교 교육과 생활에서 벗어나 진리를 찾기 위해 떠납니다. 사문과의 생활 친구 고빈다와 함께 고행 생활을 하는 사문이 되어 물질적 쾌락을 부정하고 명상을 통해 깨달음을 추구합니다. 고타마 붓다와의 만남 싯다르타는 고타마 붓다(석가모니)를 만나 가르침을 듣지만, 자신만의 길을 가기로 결심합니다. 고빈다는 붓다의 제자가 되지만, 싯다르타는 홀로 떠납니다. 카밀라와의 삶 싯다르타는 도시로 가서 매춘부 카밀라를 만나 사랑을 배우고, 상인 카마스와미에게서 물질적 성공을 배웁니다. 그러나 이 모든 것이 그에게 진정한 만족을 주지 못합니다. 강가의 깨달음 싯다르타는 강가에서 배를 젓는 배사공 바수데바를 만나 그의 단순한 삶을 통해 깊은 깨달음을 얻습니다. 결국, 그는 강을 통해 삶의 진정한 본질을 이해하게 됩니다. 영적 여정: 싯다르타의 삶은 자아를 찾기 위한 끝없는 탐구입니다.
자기 발견: 다른 사람들의 가르침이 아닌, 자신의 경험을 통해 깨달음을 얻는 것이 중요하다는 메시지를 전달합니다.
이원성의 초월: 세속적인 삶과 영적인 삶을 모두 경험하며 이 둘의 경계를 넘나드는 과정이 묘사됩니다. 영적 탐구와 철학: "싯다르타"는 동양 철학과 서양 철학을 통합한 헤세의 대표작으로, 많은 이들에게 영감과 깨달음을 주었습니다.
개인주의와 자아 실현: 싯다르타의 이야기는 현대 사회에서도 여전히 중요한 주제인 자기 발견과 자아 실현에 대해 깊이 생각하게 합니다.
문학적 가치: 아름다운 문체와 깊이 있는 철학적 성찰로 인해 세계 문학사에서 중요한 위치를 차지합니다. 철학과 영성에 관심 있는 독자: 자아 탐구와 영적 여정을 다룬 책을 찾는 독자에게 적합합니다.
자기 계발서 애호가: 자신의 삶의 의미를 찾고자 하는 사람들에게 큰 영감을 줄 수 있습니다.
문학 애호가: 헤르만 헤세의 문학적 재능과 아름다운 글쓰기를 경험하고 싶은 독자에게 추천합니다.

로베스피에르(Maximilien Robespierre)는 프랑스 혁명의 중요한 인물로, 1758년에 태어나 1794년에 처형되었습니다. 그는 프랑스 혁명 초기에 입법 의회와 국민 협회의 중요한 멤버로 활동했으며, 혁명적 정부의 핵심 인물 중 한 명으로 부상했습니다.로베스피에르는 프랑스 혁명의 가장 극단적이고 폭력적인 단계인 '테러의 시대(Terror)'를 주도했습니다. 그는 혁명을 보호하고 적들을 제거하기 위해 폭력과 대규모 처형을 사용했습니다. 그의 이러한 행동은 그를 '테러의 상징'으로 만들었으며, 많은 무고한 사람들이 길로틴으로 처형되었습니다.로베스피에르는 자코뱅 클럽의 지도자로, 공화주의와 평등의 이상을 강하게 옹호했습니다. 그는 또한 왕정을 폐지하고 프랑스 제1공화국을 설립하는 데 중요한 역할을 했습니다. 그는 국가의 강력한 중앙 집권화를 추진했으며, 개인의 자유보다는 공공의 이익을 우선시하는 정치 철학을 가지고 있었습니다.하지만, 로베스피에르는 그의 독재적이고 폭력적인 방법들로 인해 결국 많은 적을 만들었습니다. 1794년, 그는 반대파에 의해 권력에서 축출되었고, 길로틴으로 처형되었습니다. 그의 사망은 '테러의 시대'의 종말을 의미하며, 프랑스 혁명의 변화를 가져왔습니다.로베스피에르의 역사적 평가는 복잡합니다. 어떤 이들은 그를 혁명적 이상을 위해 싸운 영웅으로 보는 반면, 다른 이들은 그의 폭력과 독재를 비판하며 두려움의 상징으로 여깁니다. 그의 인물과 행동은 프랑스 혁명과 그 이후의 역사에 깊은 영향을 미쳤으며, 현대에도 여전히 많은 토론과 연구의 대상이 되고 있습니다.]]></description><link>books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/reference/로베스피에르.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/Studies/참을 수 없는 존재의 가벼움/Reference/로베스피에르.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024

being]]></title><description><![CDATA["Unbearable Lightness of Being" by Milan Kundera is a profoundly insightful novel that delves into the intricate nuances of love, politics, and existential dilemmas. Set against the backdrop of the 1968 Prague Spring and its subsequent Soviet-led invasion, the story primarily follows the lives of Tomas, a surgeon and a philanderer, and Tereza, his wife and a photographer, along with other central characters like Sabina, Tomas's mistress, and Franz, her lover.Kundera masterfully explores the dichotomy of lightness and weight, a central theme of the novel. This philosophical concept questions whether life is a fleeting, insignificant occurrence (lightness) or a series of meaningful events and responsibilities (weight). Through his characters, Kundera examines how each approach impacts one's existence and relationships.The novel is also remarkable for its exploration of political and historical contexts, particularly the impact of Czechoslovakia's political turmoil on its citizens. It provides a poignant commentary on how external political forces can intrude into and shape personal lives, relationships, and moral decisions.Moreover, Kundera's narrative style, characterized by its introspective and often non-linear approach, invites readers to engage deeply with the characters' psychological landscapes. This introspection is balanced with moments of irony and humor, making the novel as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.In terms of its impact on literature and culture, "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" stands out for its philosophical depth, its innovative narrative structure, and its profound exploration of human emotions and the existential plight. It remains a vital read for anyone interested in the intersections of love, personal freedom, and the inescapable influence of historical and political contexts on human life.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/milan-kundera/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being/]]></description><link>books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/reference/kirkus-reviews-the-unbearable-lightness-of-being.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/Studies/참을 수 없는 존재의 가벼움/Reference/Kirkus Reviews - the Unbearable lightness of being.canvas</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jan 2024 09:04:52 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pasted image 20240118201129]]></title><description><![CDATA[<img src="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/reference/pasted-image-20240118201129.png" target="_self">]]></description><link>books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/reference/pasted-image-20240118201129.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Books/Studies/참을 수 없는 존재의 가벼움/Reference/Pasted image 20240118201129.png</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 11:11:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/reference/pasted-image-20240118201129.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="books/studies/참을-수-없는-존재의-가벼움/reference/pasted-image-20240118201129.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
