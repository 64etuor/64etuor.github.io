While there are particular scenarios where an author may indeed want to prevent scrolling, analysis indicates that the majority of touch event handlers on the web never actually\ncall preventDefault(), so browsers often block scrolling unnecessarily. For instance, in Chrome for Android 80% of the touch events that block scrolling never actually prevent it. 10% of these events add more than 100ms of delay to the start of scrolling, and a catastrophic delay of at least 500ms occurs in 1% of scrolls.<br>Many developers are surprised to learn that <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://rbyers.github.io/janky-touch-scroll.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://rbyers.github.io/janky-touch-scroll.html\" target=\"_self\">simply adding an empty touch handler to their document</a> can have a<br>\nsignificant negative impact on scroll performance. Developers quite reasonably expect that the act of observing an event <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#observing-event-listeners\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#observing-event-listeners\" target=\"_self\">should not have any side-effects</a>.<br>The fundamental problem here is not limited to touch events. <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#events-wheelevents\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#events-wheelevents\" target=\"_self\"><code></code> events</a>wheel<br>\nsuffer from an identical issue. In contrast, <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/\" target=\"_self\">pointer event handlers</a> are\ndesigned to never delay scrolling (though developers can declaratively suppress scrolling altogether with the touch-action CSS property), so do not suffer from this issue. Essentially the passive event listener proposal brings the performance properties of pointer events to touch and wheel events.<br>This proposal provides a way for authors to indicate at handler registration time whether the handler may call preventDefault() on the event (i.e. whether it needs an event that is <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-cancelable\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-cancelable\" target=\"_self\">cancelable</a>). When no touch or wheel handlers at a particular point require a cancelable event, a user agent is free to start scrolling immediately without waiting for JavaScript. That is, passive listeners are free from surprising performance side-effects.First, we need a mechanism for attaching additional information to an event listener. Today the capture argument to addEventListener is the closest example of something like this, but its usage is pretty opaque: document.addEventListener('touchstart', handler, true);\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dictdef-eventlisteneroptions\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dictdef-eventlisteneroptions\" target=\"_self\"><code></code></a>EventListenerOptions lets us write this more explicitly as: document.addEventListener('touchstart', handler, {capture: true});\n<br>This is simply the new (extensible) syntax for existing behavior - specifying <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing#capturing\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://javascript.info/tutorial/bubbling-and-capturing#capturing\" target=\"_self\">whether you want the listener invoked during the capture phase or bubbling phase</a>.Now that we have an extensible syntax for specifying options at event handler registration time, we can add a new passive option which declares up-front that the listener will never call preventDefault() on the event. If it does, the user agent will just ignore the request (ideally generating at least a console warning), as it already does for events with Event.cancelable=false. A developer can verify this by querying Event.defaultPrevented before and after calling preventDefault(). Eg: addEventListener(document, \"touchstart\", function(e) { console.log(e.defaultPrevented); // will be false e.preventDefault(); // does nothing since the listener is passive console.log(e.defaultPrevented); // still false }, Modernizr.passiveeventlisteners ? {passive: true} : false);\n<br>Now rather than having to block scrolling whenever there are any touch or wheel listener, the browser only needs to do this when there are non-passive listeners (see <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"http://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#cancelability\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"http://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#cancelability\" target=\"_self\">TouchEvents spec</a>). passive listeners are free of performance side-effects.By marking a touch or wheel listener as passive, the developer is promising the handler won't call preventDefault to disable scrolling. This frees the browser up to respond to scrolling immediately without waiting for JavaScript, thus ensuring a reliably smooth scrolling experience for the user.<br>Because older browsers will interpret any object in the 3rd argument as a true value for the capture argument, it's important for developers to use feature detection or <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/WebReflection/dom4\" target=\"_self\">a polyfill</a> when using this API, to avoid unforeseen results. Feature detection for specific options can be done as follows:// Test via a getter in the options object to see if the passive property is accessed\nvar supportsPassive = false;\ntry { var opts = Object.defineProperty({}, 'passive', { get: function() { supportsPassive = true; } }); window.addEventListener(\"testPassive\", null, opts); window.removeEventListener(\"testPassive\", null, opts);\n} catch (e) {} // Use our detect's results. passive applied if supported, capture will be false either way.\nelem.addEventListener('touchstart', fn, supportsPassive ? { passive: true } : false); <br>To make this simpler you can use the feature detect from <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/rafrex/detect-it\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/rafrex/detect-it\" target=\"_self\">Detect It</a>, eg: elem.addEventListener('touchstart', fn, detectIt.passiveEvents ? {passive:true} : false);\n<br><a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://modernizr.com/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://modernizr.com/\" target=\"_self\">Modernizr</a> also has a detect <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1982\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/pull/1982\" target=\"_self\">here</a>. There is an <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/107\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/heycam/webidl/issues/107\" target=\"_self\">open standards debate</a> around providing a simpler API for dictionary member feature detection.There are scenarios where an author may intentionally want to consistently disable scrolling by cancelling all touch or wheel events. These include:\nPanning and zooming a map\nFull-page/full-screen games\nIn these cases, the current behavior (which prevents scrolling optimization) is perfectly adequate, since scrolling itself is being prevented consistently. There is no need to use passive listeners in these cases, though it's often still a good idea to apply a touch-action: none CSS rule to make your intention explicit (eg. supporting browsers with Pointer Events but not Touch Events). However, in a number of common scenarios events don't need to block scrolling - for instance:\nUser activity monitoring which just wants to know when the user was last active\ntouchstart handlers that hide some active UI (like tooltips)\ntouchstart and touchend handlers that style UI elements (without suppressing the click event).\nFor these scenarios, the passive option can be added (with appropriate feature detection) without any other code changes, resulting in a significantly smoother scrolling experience.There are a few more complicated scenarios where the handler only wants to suppress scrolling under certain conditions, such as:\nSwiping horizontally to rotate a carousel, dismiss an item or reveal a drawer, while still permitting vertical scrolling. <br>In this case, use <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action\" target=\"_self\">touch-action: pan-y</a> to declaratively disable scrolling that starts along the horizontal axis without having to call preventDefault() (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://rbyers.github.io/touch-action.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://rbyers.github.io/touch-action.html\" target=\"_self\">test page</a>).\nTo continue to work correctly in all browsers, calls to preventDefault should be conditional on the lack of support for the particular touch-action rule being used (note that Safari 9 currently only supports touch-action: manipulation). A UI element (like YouTube's volume slider) which slides on horizontal wheel events without changing the scrolling behavior on vertical wheel events. Since there is no equivalent of \"touch-action\" for wheel events, this case can only be implemented with non-passive wheel listeners.\nEvent delegation patterns where the code that adds the listener won't know if the consumer will cancel the event. One option here is to do delegation separately for passive and non-passive listeners (as if they were different event types entirely).\n<br>It's also possible to leverage touch-action as above (treating Touch Events as you would <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/\" target=\"_self\">Pointer Events</a>. <br>You can get a quick idea of the benefit possible (and potential breakage) by forcing touch/wheel listeners to be treated as passive via chrome://flags/#passive-listener-default (new in Chrome 52).

If your site has logic that runs for &gt;100ms at a time, it will still feel sluggish in response to taps / clicks. Passive event listeners just allow developers to decouple the issue of having JS responsiveness reflected in scroll performance from the desire to monitor input events. In particular, developers of third-party analytics libraries can now have some confidence that their use of light-weight event listeners will not fundamentally change the observed performance characteristics of any page using their code.<br>See the links <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://github.com/WICG/EventListenerOptions\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://github.com/WICG/EventListenerOptions\" target=\"_self\">here</a> for more details.

Answer: The assembly instructions are currently only available in Korean. We recognize the importance of making these accessible to our team in China and plan to have them translated into English as an intermediary step. This process is expected to take approximately one week. We will explore options for translation into Chinese to ensure clarity and accessibility for all team members involved in the assembly process. Question: Do we have visual aids, such as videos, to supplement the assembly instructions? Answer: At the moment, we do not have video documentation of the assembly process. However, we acknowledge the value of visual aids in enhancing understanding and reducing the potential for errors. We will initiate the creation of video tutorials that detail the assembly process, ensuring that these resources are comprehensive and easy to follow. Question: What specific assembly procedures are currently undertaken by the Korean CM, and are we fully aware of these processes? Answer: The Korean CM handles a range of assembly procedures that are documented in our standard operating procedures. However, it's essential to conduct a thorough review to ensure that all processes are fully captured and up-to-date. We are in the process of auditing these procedures to confirm their completeness and accuracy. Question: Considering the assembly procedures performed by the Korean CM, do we believe it's feasible to replicate these processes in China without significant obstacles? Answer: Based on our initial assessment, we believe that transitioning these assembly processes to China is feasible. The procedures do not require specialized skills that cannot be replicated or taught in China. However, we must ensure that all procedural documentation is current, translated, and adapted as necessary to meet any local regulatory requirements or operational differences. Question: Are there any anticipated challenges or limitations in transferring the assembly line to China, such as differences in regulations, standards, or workforce skills? Answer: While we anticipate a smooth transition overall, we are mindful of potential challenges such as differences in regulatory standards, the need for workforce training, and the adaptation of procedures to local practices. We are committed to conducting a detailed analysis to identify any such challenges early in the process and develop strategies to address them effectively. Question: What will be the approach if there are questions raised during the meeting that cannot be immediately answered? Answer: Should any questions arise that I cannot answer directly, I will take detailed notes and follow up with my direct manager to ensure a timely and accurate response. We are committed to transparency and effective communication throughout this transition process. It's clear from your preparation that while there are areas needing attention, such as the translation of documentation and the creation of visual aids, you have a proactive plan to address these needs. Emphasizing your commitment to a thorough review and update of assembly procedures, along with a strategic approach to overcoming potential challenges, will be key to reassuring the executives of the feasibility and readiness for the transition.Youcan you make it little bit easier? my mother tongue is korean, so some of that sentences are hard to memorize for me.ChatGPTChatGPTCertainly! Let's simplify the responses for your meeting: Question: Do we need to translate the assembly instructions? Are there videos? Answer: Yes, the instructions are only in Korean now. We need to translate them into English, which will take about a week. We don't have videos yet, but we plan to make them to help everyone understand the process better. Question: Can we use the same assembly procedures in China as in Korea? Answer: The procedures we use in Korea can be used in China too. We don't see big problems with moving the assembly there. Most tasks don't need special skills. But, we need to update and translate our instructions to make sure everyone can follow them. Question: What problems might we face moving to China? Answer: We might face some challenges, like different rules or the need to train the team in China. But we believe we can handle these by planning well and updating our instructions. Question: How long will it take to get all the documentation ready for the China team? Answer: We need about one week to translate the current documents into English. Making videos and further translations might take a bit more time. Question: Will the training materials be understandable for someone who doesn't speak Korean? Answer: Yes, we will translate everything into English first, and then into Chinese if needed, to make sure everyone can understand. Question: How do we ensure the quality of the assembly process remains high after moving to China? Answer: We will train the China team using our updated guides and videos. We will also check the assembly quality regularly. Question: Are there any parts of the assembly that must stay in Korea? Answer: Right now, we think everything can move to China. But we will double-check to make sure. Question: What is our timeline for moving the assembly line to China? Answer: We are still planning, but we will share a timeline as soon as we have it. Question: How will we handle differences in work culture between Korea and China? Answer: We will learn about the work culture in China and adapt our training and management to fit well with the team there. Question: Do we need any special permissions or certifications to start manufacturing in China? Answer: We are checking on this. We will get all the needed permissions and certifications before we start. Question: How will we transfer equipment and materials to China? Answer: We are planning the best way to do this. We will make sure everything is safe and cost-effective. Question: What if we face unexpected challenges during the move? Answer: We will plan carefully and have backup plans. We will solve problems as they come. Question: How will we communicate with the team in China? Answer: We will use English for official communication. We might also use translators when needed to make sure everyone understands. Question: Will there be ongoing support from Korea to the China team? Answer: Yes, we will keep supporting the China team. We can have regular meetings and visits to make sure everything goes well. Question: How will this move affect our delivery times to customers? Answer: We plan to keep delivery times the same, or even improve them by being closer to some of our customers.

(다른 사람이 적어준 것이 아닙니다) 그렇기 때문에 메모에 적힌 것은 내 머리 속에서 프로세싱 된 것의 결과물을 적은 것입니다. 근데 메모를 하는 과정에서 내 머릿 속에서는 2가지가 동시에 처리됩니다. 내가 외부적으로 책 / 강연 / 영상 등을 보고 읽고 들은 것을 바탕으로 이해한 것에 대한 내용 내가 기존에 아는 것(나의 경험, 지식, 가치관 등)들을 바탕으로 연계시긴 새로운 (창의적인) 생각 그런데 여기서 2가지가 공존하는 상황에서 '새로운' 것은 '내 머릿속에서' 나오는 것이다 소중한 두뇌 파워와 소중한 시간을 이용해 메모를 적은 것인데, 여기서 내 생각이 없으면 내 것이 아닌, 남의 것을 적고 요약하는데 소중한 시간을 쓴 것이 아닌가? 그래서 메모할 때에는 온전히 나의 생각들이 꼭 포함되어야 한다 기억하고 싶은 것도 아닌데 굳이 왜 적을 필요가 있을까? 내가 어떤 것을 메모하려고 지금 이 순간에 선택을 한 것은 다음과 같다 뭔가 유용하다고 생각했기 때문에, 아니면 뭔가 마음에 들었거나, 다시 활용하고 싶어 했을 것이다. 이유는 무엇이든지 간에, '기억하고 싶은 것'이 아니면 굳이 적을 필요가 없다. 시간낭비다 그런데 기억하고 싶은 것이 아닌데도 적은 것이라면, 죄책감을 가질 필요 없다. 만약에 막상 작성해놓고 보니 필요없고 굳이 기억하고 소유하고 싶은 것이 아니면 과감히 버리자. 기억하고 싶은 것은 곧 언젠가는 다시 보고싶고 활용하고 싶다는 의미이다. 다시 말해, 메모의 최종적인 목적은 다음과 같다. 머지않은 미래에 있는 나를 위해 그 메모를 보낸다. 그 미래의 내가 그 메모를 보고 새로운 영감을 얻어, 더 많은 가치를 창출해낸다. 이런 최종적인 목적을 인지하였으면, 메모를 할 때는 머지 않은 미래를 위해 이렇게 해야 된다. [Actionable] 그 메모를 보고 다시 활용할 수 있는 방식으로 작성되어야 되어 한다. [Strategically Stored] 활용될 방향을 생각해서 저장해야 한다 메모는 너무 길면, 그것을 다시 보지 않게 된다. 그런데 인간은 게으르다. 심지어 나도 게으르다. 메모를 복습하고 새로운 아이디어를 위해 열어봤는데 너무 길면 귀찮게 될 경우도 많다. 그래서, 메모를 할 때... 최대한 간결해야 한다. 모든 디테일을 다 넣을 필요도 없고, 거기에 함축되어도 된다. (원자처럼 Atomic하게) 긴 메모일 경우, 그것을 함축시키는 것을 Summary같이 함축된 것을 넣어놓아야 한다. 열심히 나의 생각을 함축되게 잘 표현되어 놓고, 다시 활용할 수 있도록 정리가 되어있어도, 찾지 못하면 쓸모가 없어진다. 못 찾으면, 그 메모에 든 가치를 실현시킬 수 없는 것이다. <br>3번에서 '저장'하는 것도 중요하지만, 링크 <a data-href=\"Link\" href=\"https://64etuor.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Link</a> 나 태그 <a data-href=\"Tag\" href=\"https://64etuor.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Tag</a> 나 파일 속성<a data-href=\"Properties\" href=\"https://64etuor.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Properties</a> 등의 방법들을 통해 쉽고 빠르게 찾을 수 있도록 해야 한다. 이 철학들은 일기와 비유할 수 있을 것 것 같다.<br>이 철학들은 <a data-href=\"Building a Second Brain\" href=\"https://64etuor.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Building a Second Brain</a>, <a data-href=\"Zettelkasten\" href=\"https://64etuor.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Zettelkasten</a>등을 통해 얻은 깨달음이기도 한데,<br>최근에 나온 김익한 교수님의 '<a data-href=\"거인의 메모\" href=\"https://64etuor.github.io/.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">거인의 메모</a>'에도 나와있는 내용이다.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#zettel"],"headers":[{"heading":"<strong> Status</strong>","level":4,"id":"**_Status**_0"},{"heading":"Summary of AI를 제3의 두뇌로 이용하기 1편. 메모에 AI 이용 철학","level":2,"id":"Summary_of_AI를_제3의_두뇌로_이용하기_1편._메모에_AI_이용_철학_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Contexts</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Contexts**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>나의 메모철학 5S</strong>","level":2,"id":"**나의_메모철학_5S**_0"},{"heading":"1.

It’s hard to see trailing whitespace in an editor, and many people accidentally or intentionally put two spaces after every sentence.

CommonMark and a few other lightweight markup languages let you type a backslash (\\) at the end of the line, but not all Markdown applications support this, so it isn’t a great option from a compatibility perspective. And at least a couple lightweight markup languages don’t require anything at the end of the line — just type return and they’ll create a line break.You can add emphasis by making text bold or italic.To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.Markdown applications don’t agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of a word.

주도했습니다. 그는 혁명을 보호하고 적들을 제거하기 위해 폭력과 대규모 처형을 사용했습니다. 그의 이러한 행동은 그를 '테러의 상징'으로 만들었으며, 많은 무고한 사람들이 길로틴으로 처형되었습니다.로베스피에르는 자코뱅 클럽의 지도자로, 공화주의와 평등의 이상을 강하게 옹호했습니다. 그는 또한 왕정을 폐지하고 프랑스 제1공화국을 설립하는 데 중요한 역할을 했습니다. 그는 국가의 강력한 중앙 집권화를 추진했으며, 개인의 자유보다는 공공의 이익을 우선시하는 정치 철학을 가지고 있었습니다.하지만, 로베스피에르는 그의 독재적이고 폭력적인 방법들로 인해 결국 많은 적을 만들었습니다. 1794년, 그는 반대파에 의해 권력에서 축출되었고, 길로틴으로 처형되었습니다. 그의 사망은 '테러의 시대'의 종말을 의미하며, 프랑스 혁명의 변화를 가져왔습니다.로베스피에르의 역사적 평가는 복잡합니다. 어떤 이들은 그를 혁명적 이상을 위해 싸운 영웅으로 보는 반면, 다른 이들은 그의 폭력과 독재를 비판하며 두려움의 상징으로 여깁니다. 그의 인물과 행동은 프랑스 혁명과 그 이후의 역사에 깊은 영향을 미쳤으며, 현대에도 여전히 많은 토론과 연구의 대상이 되고 있습니다.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Yangha

Reviews - the Unbearable lightness of being","icon":"","description":"\"Unbearable Lightness of Being\" by Milan Kundera is a profoundly insightful novel that delves into the intricate nuances of love, politics, and existential dilemmas. Set against the backdrop of the 1968 Prague Spring and its subsequent Soviet-led invasion, the story primarily follows the lives of Tomas, a surgeon and a philanderer, and Tereza, his wife and a photographer, along with other central characters like Sabina, Tomas's mistress, and Franz, her lover.Kundera masterfully explores the dichotomy of lightness and weight, a central theme of the novel. This philosophical concept questions whether life is a fleeting, insignificant occurrence (lightness) or a series of meaningful events and responsibilities (weight). Through his characters, Kundera examines how each approach impacts one's existence and relationships.The novel is also remarkable for its exploration of political and historical contexts, particularly the impact of Czechoslovakia's political turmoil on its citizens. It provides a poignant commentary on how external political forces can intrude into and shape personal lives, relationships, and moral decisions.Moreover, Kundera's narrative style, characterized by its introspective and often non-linear approach, invites readers to engage deeply with the characters' psychological landscapes. This introspection is balanced with moments of irony and humor, making the novel as intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally resonant.In terms of its impact on literature and culture, \"The Unbearable Lightness of Being\" stands out for its philosophical depth, its innovative narrative structure, and its profound exploration of human emotions and the existential plight. It remains a vital read for anyone interested in the intersections of love, personal freedom, and the inescapable influence of historical and political contexts on human life.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/milan-kundera/the-unbearable-lightness-of-being/","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"Yangha
